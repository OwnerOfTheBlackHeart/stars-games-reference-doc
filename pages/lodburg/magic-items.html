	<p>
		This strange sextant does not view the sun or the stars, but instead strange, colorful energies that can only be seen through the
		mirrors of the sextant. A skilled user of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-omiel">The Om'iel</a> Sextant can use the device to
		determine what plane they are on, as well as their general position, though this is less accurate than the readings of a normal sextant.

		user to be slotted into the powersuit.
