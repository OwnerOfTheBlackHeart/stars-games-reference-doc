    Wabril traits:
    * Small ears
    * Yellow, orange, red eyes
    * White to gray to black hair, usually shiny
    * Yellow-brown skin

	The Wabril are despised as simply "trouble". While most Axons associate them with theft and murder, the more well traveled
	may also imply slavery, or really any illegal activity.
