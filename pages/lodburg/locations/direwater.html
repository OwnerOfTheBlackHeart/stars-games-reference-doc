<h3 id="maerwynn">Maerwynn</h3>
<p>
	Maerwynn is a 6' 6" dragonfolk with a tall, brown crest running from her brow to the base of her neck, piercing white eyes and dull yellow
	scales. Maerwynn has a long, thin snout and wide, powerful torso, despite her age. Maerwynn wears a heavy wool dress with an equally heavy
	wool coat, neither of which are dyed, and an abundance of brass jewelry.
</p>
<p>
	Maerwynn is old, even for her people, and while she is no less strong than any others of her kind, Maerwynn cannot move at the speed she
	used to. Despite her difficulties moving, Maerwynn continues to farm her berry bushes and sheep.

<h3 id="usilova-olegovna">Usilova Olegovna</h3>
<p>
	Usilova is a 5' 2", female human with shiny, gray hair that freely falls to the back of her knees, B cup titties, orange eyes, dark brown
	skin, and smallish ears. Usilova wears the pelts of wolves in a shabby mockery of armor that, while not particularly protective, is at
	least warm.
</p>
<p>
	Usilova is rarely found in Direwater's limits, instead she is normally out guiding her flock of sheep and goats in the swamp surrounding
	Direwater.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="lodburg-full usilova-olegovna-sexual-characteristics">
	<p>
		If Usilova is brought up among the locals of Direwater, they will mention that they're pretty sure she's huffed too much swamp gas, and
		that she can be twitchy around people. They aren't far off, as Usilova is half-savage.

<ap-auth-container permissions="lodburg-full egbryht-leadership">
	<p>
		Egbryht was able to be elected by the local <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon#council-of-elders">Council of Elders</a> to his position
		because the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-wabril">Wabril</a> pay little heed to the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> view of
		the sexes.

	<p>
		Egbryht is looking for a deniable asset to put down a pair of feuding families, who are using their influence force the local
