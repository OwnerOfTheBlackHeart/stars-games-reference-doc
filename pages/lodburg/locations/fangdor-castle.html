<h1>Fangdor Castle</h1>
<p>
	Located on the river's mouth, Fangdor Castle was originally built by <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-rauber-tribes">Rauber</a> seeking to
	create a safe place for themselves to hide. However, they were found out and the early <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> took
	the castle by sneaking in and attacking the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-rauber-tribes">Rauber</a> castle from within, as to not damage
	the castle itself.
