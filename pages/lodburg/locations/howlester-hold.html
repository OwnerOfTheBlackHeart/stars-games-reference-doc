<h1>Howlester Hold</h1>
<p>
	An old <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-rauber-tribes">Rauber</a> fort, Howlester Hold is now the timber and mud home of the Howlester
	family, a family who moved to Lodburg roughly a decade ago. All of the statues and decorative busts contain at least traces of silver in
	them, a hint as to the abundance of wealth in the Howlesters' homeland.
</p>
<p>
	For reasons unknown, the Howlester family does not allow anyone but their most trusted servants and associates to stay the night in their
	fort.

		The Howlester family is inflicted with the curse of lycanthropy and use their castle as a way to keep them isolated from anyone that
		they could cause harm to. To further ensure that they do not harm anyone, they only allow skilled and trusted werewolf hunters and
		inquisitors to stay in their how, with several tasked with ensure the safety of both the family and their guests on nights of the full
		moon.
