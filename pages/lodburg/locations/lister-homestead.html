<h1>Lister Homestead</h1>
<p>
	Located roughly 20 miles from <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-direwater">Direwater</a>, the Lister Homestead is a large, main house
	surrounded by incomplete supporting buildings, some of which include grain silos, barns, sheds, out buildings and fencing. Much of the
	construction is, supposedly, delayed by the difficulty of getting resources through the rough hills and the lack of skilled builders on
	the homestead.
</p>
<p>
	The farmstead mainly grows hearty grains (mainly barley) and sturdy, cold resistant vegetables. The Lister Homestead also hosts a
	population of goats and longhaired, domestic ox.

		The Lister family is secretly slavers who are equal parts breeding slaves and selling slave products, namely magically preserved breast
		milk, as well as cheese and butter produced from it. They mainly sell to curio traders that port their products overseas to nobles that
		are willing to pay significant money for such things.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="#estrith-lister">Estrith</a> is always looking for new slaves, especially those that can quickly become "productive." Even

	<p>
		The Listers took on <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> names upon arriving in Lodburg to help them blend in with the mutt
