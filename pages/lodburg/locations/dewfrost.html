	The northernmost settlement of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a>, Dewfrost is a town of primarily goblins with growing
	populations of hobgoblins. Throughout the town are "woodgas bakeries" that produce woodgas and charcoal, with the woodgas being pumped
	through the town to power fireplaces, ovens and "brass candles". This is among the other minor innovations that have started to pop up
	throughout Dewfrost.
</p>
<p>
	The goblins and hobgoblins of Dewfrost are notable for lacking the typical droopy ears and big noses of goblins elsewhere, instead having
	pig-like faces with wide mouths, sunken eyes and large, upward pointing ears. They have dark hair colors, such as black or blood red,
	though the hobgoblins occasionally develop lighter hair colors. The skin of Dewfrost goblins can range from green to a brown, rusty color.
	Their eye colors are yellows, reds and purples, with some individuals lacking pupils and the whites of their eyes.
</p>
<p>
	The goblins and hobgoblins of Dewfrost can trace their lineage back to 3 different sources: slaves of the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-rauber-tribes">Rauber</a> that were saved by the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axons</a> when they
	"liberated" the land from the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-rauber-tribes">Rauber</a>, the handful of goblins the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axons</a> brought with them to help maintain their ships, and a group of refugees that came to Lodburg
	roughly 70 years ago. These three groups originally integrated fully into <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> culture, but after
	issues arising from the collateral damage of overly excited experimentation, the goblins that would find Dewfrost decided that it would be
	best to leave on good terms with their human friends and take their <i>occasionally</i> dangerous experiments a good distance away from
	the humans, who were very against getting accidentally hurt.
</p>
<p>
	Even after the last 40+ years of "isolation" from <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> humans, the residents of Dewfrost consider
	themselves as <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> as any human of Thornhost, and most
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axons</a> feel the same.

<p>
	A carved stone monument located on the western edge of Dewfrost, the Chillforest Monument is a recently erected "statue" in honor of those
	lost to the eaglemen attack. Chiseled into the monument are the names of every person, whose name at least one goblin remembered, who died
	during the Chillforest Massacre.
