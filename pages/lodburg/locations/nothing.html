<h1>The City of Nothing</h1>
<p>
	Located somewhere out in the Boulderlands, the City of Nothing is known only through the traders that occasionally travel to
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> settlements, trading valuable Boulderlands herbs for food and other consumable goods. While
	expeditions have been made to reach the City of Nothing, the only ones to have returned are those that never reached their destination.

	<p>
		Created by the Om'iel, these creatures resemble human hearts walking around on spider-like metal legs, searching for a humanoid host to
		replace the heart of. Once a bodysnatcher has replaced a humanoid's heart, they gain control of them.
	</p>
	<p>
		While the Om'iel had an original purpose for the bodysnatchers, it has been fulfilled, leaving the creatures to their own devices. Not
		wanting to be a part of any society which views them as slaves or monsters, the bodysnatchers have retreated to the boulder strewn
		snowlands where they have built the city of Nothing, the buildings of which are carved into the boulders.
	</p>
	<p>
		The bodysnatchers jealously protect Nothing, though they try to capture intruders alive so that those bodysnatchers that have lost their
		bodies can take the freshly captured hosts.

	<p>The city of Nothing can contains the knowledge of the rune Vu'xin.</p>
