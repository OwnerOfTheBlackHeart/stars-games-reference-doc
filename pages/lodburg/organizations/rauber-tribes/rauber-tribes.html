<p>
	The original "discoverers" of Lodburg, which they call Lod, the Rauber were a group of vikings and pirates that established the original
	forts in Lod to serve as a place to rest and store loot. However, after the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> forced them
	inland, the Rauber have begun forming nomadic tribes and forgotten their past as raiders and pirates.
</p>
<p>
	Rauber tribes are lead by a chieftan, the strongest warrior or most respected elder in the tribe, each of which has their own plans and
	ideas of how they will destroy the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> and retake their ancestral fortresses.
</p>
<p>
	Raubers do not make much of their own metal, nor do they commonly work the metal they find. Instead, Raubers armor, weapons and tools are
	most commonly stolen from the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axons</a>. While rare, some brave individuals manage to trade with the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axons</a>, bringing back custom made, and highly coveted, items.

		Spending the last 100 years in the frozen forests and plains of Lodburg, many Rauber bloodlines have been mutated by the snow and fae
		magics, becoming resistant to their unwilling home.
