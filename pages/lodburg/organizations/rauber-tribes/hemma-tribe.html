<h1>The Hemma Tribe</h1>
<p>
	Claiming the plains between the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-minor-locations#everrain">Everrain</a> and the southern swamps, the Hemma
	Tribe is one of the largest <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-rauber-tribes">Rauber tribes</a>. While they are close to the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a>, the Hemma Tribe rarely strays near the fortifications to their ancestral rivals.
</p>
<p>
	The current chieftain of the Hemma Tribe is <a href="#norgard-hemma">Norgard Hemma</a>, a young warrior woman who has recently taken
	power.

		Norgard is a 5' 5" tall, female human with lower-back length brown hair with the sides of her head shaved, C cup titties, green eyes,
		and pale skin. Norgard has plentiful scars, but the notable scars are the claw scars from her brow to the right side of her face and the
		slash scar on her left cheek, along her jawline. For armor, Norgard wears large bones, or scales, backed by leather and bear fur.
		Norgard favors the use of a heavy looking, one-handed axe as her primary weapon.

		<p>
			Norgard gained the title of chieftain by gaining the favor of the elders of the Hemma tribe and utilizing their influence to strip the
			prior chieftain's support before killing her in 1 on 1 combat.

			Norgard's policy matches that of the elders that she utilized to aid in defeating the prior chieftain: One of weariness and war
			fatigue, being one of the tribes closest to the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a>, they are also the tribe that has
			consistently suffered the greatest casualties over the several pseudo-wars the
			<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-rauber-tribes">Rauber</a> have waged. Norgard has also taken the stance that the Hemma Tribe should look
			to settle and form a village, but she is slow to implement this as the plan is unpopular with the younger Hemmas and the tribe has no
			experience in building, or even living in, permanent settlements.

		<p>Norgard is an elementalist/warrior.</p>
		<p>
			Norgard has a special ability that allows her to cast her elementalist spells and/or arts through a weapon rather than an open hand.
			When doing so, the effect of the spell, or art, is stored in the striking part of the weapon (such as the blade) and is released on a
			successful attack, with the target of the attack becoming the target of the spell/art. Regaurdless of the number of targets, or area
			of effect, of the spell, or art, only the target of the melee attack that discharged the spell, or art, suffers the effects. Norgard
			can teach this if one was to gain her favor.
