		slash scar on her left cheek, along her jawline. For armor, Norgard wears large bones, or scales, backed by leather and bear fur.
		Norgard favors the use of a heavy looking, one-handed axe as her primary weapon.

		<p>Norgard is an elementalist/warrior.</p>
		<p>
			Norgard has a special ability that allows her to cast her elementalist spells and/or arts through a weapon rather than an open hand.
			When doing so, the effect of the spell, or art, is stored in the striking part of the weapon (such as the blade) and is released on a
			successful attack, with the target of the attack becoming the target of the spell/art. Regaurdless of the number of targets, or area
			of effect, of the spell, or art, only the target of the melee attack that discharged the spell, or art, suffers the effects. Norgard
			can teach this if one was to gain her favor.
