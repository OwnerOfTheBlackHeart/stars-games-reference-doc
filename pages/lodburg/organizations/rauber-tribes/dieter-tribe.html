<h1>The Dieter Tribe</h1>
<p>
	Claiming the Squatpoint Mountain and the forests to the north of it, the Dieter Tribe has ample access to all the resources a
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-rauber-tribes">rauber</a> could need, including fairly weak <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">axons</a>.
	Using the rivers to quickly move their warriors directly into <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> and the dense forests to cover
	their retreats, the Dieter Tribe has managed to maintain well trained and well motivated raiders with ease.
</p>
<p>
	The current chieftain of the Dieter Tribe is <a href="#kirsa-dieter">Kirsa Dieter</a>, a warrior woman who killed the prior chieftain in a
	duel.
