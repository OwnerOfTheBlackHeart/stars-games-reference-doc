<h1>The Dieter Tribe</h1>
<p>
	Claiming the plains between the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-minor-locations#everrain">Everrain</a> and the southern swamps, the Hemma
	Tribe is one of the largest <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-rauber-tribes">Rauber tribes</a>. While they are close to the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a>, the Hemma Tribe rarely strays near the fortifications to their ancestral rivals.
</p>
<p>
	The current chieftain of the Hemma Tribe is <a href="#norgard-hemma">Norgard Hemma</a>, a young warrior woman who has recently taken
	power.

		paint in stripes across her face and body. She wields a pair of longswords, one she took in a raid on
