<h1>The Eike Tribe</h1>
<p>
	Claiming the Gaintfoot Forest and much of the grasslands to the north of it, the Eike Tribe is the single largest
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-rauber-tribes">Rauber tribe</a>. The Eike Tribe limits its raiding to only when their own supplies are low,
	letting the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axons</a> get comfortable with the quiet peace, so that they may strike when the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> least expect it.
</p>
<p>
	The current chieftain of the Eike Tribe is <a href="#ivo-eike">Ivo Eike</a>, a middle aged man who leads his people with care and
	strategy.

		Ivo is a 2' 11", male halfling with thick, short brown hair, deep green eyes, and ruddy skin. Ivo is covered in both scars from fighting
		animals and white tattoos, supposedly granted to him by a faerie. He wears minimal clothes, with only small, scattered pelts and leather
		belts guarding him against the world. A two-handed axe and a spiked gauntlet make up the weapons that Ivo carries on his person.

		<p>
			Somewhat untraditionally for a man of his age, Ivo gained his position as chieftain through building connections within his tribe and
			displaying tactical competence. When the prior chieftain died, he elected that Ivo, then a successful hunter of game and
			<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> scouts, take over as chieftain. To the surprise of the Eike Tribe, none challenged Ivo as
			he accepted the role of chieftain.

		<p>
			Ivo believes that the way to deal with the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axons</a> would be to launch probing strikes at the
			various fortresses and launch a full strike on the weakest. Once the fortress is under
			<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-rauber-tribes">Rauber</a> control, centralize the tribes and gather enough supplies to support a long
			term campaign, namely by raiding, and potentially destroying, <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> settlements near the taken
			fortification. Once the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-rauber-tribes">Raubers'</a> position is cemented and secured, working on
			destroying the remaining settlements and fortifications could commence, though Ivo would not be opposed to using diplomacy from that
			point to force the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> to give up their settlements and return to their foreign continents.
