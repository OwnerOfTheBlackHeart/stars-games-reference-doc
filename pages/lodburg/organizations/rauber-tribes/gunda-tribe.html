<h1>The Gunda Tribe</h1>
<p>
	The farthest tribe from the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a>, the Gunda Tribe claims the Hoarfrost Reach as their territory.
	While normally too far away from the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> to conduct raids on them, the Gunda Tribe works to
	prevent <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> colonization of the Reach.
</p>
<p>
	The current chieftain of the Gunda Tribe is <a href="#sunnhild-gunda">Sunnhild Gunda</a>, a youthful shaman with a strong grasp of
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-rauber-tribes">Rauber</a> politics and social manipulation.

		Sunnhild is a 5' 7", female human with middle-back length brown hair, frequently with thin, braided strands, C cup titties, hazel eyes,
		and pale skin with a pinkish undertone. Sunnhild makes up for a lack of battle scars with her shaman paint, the exact shapes and symbols
		varying from day to day. Sunnhild wears a red, cotton dress taken from the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> with a cape made
		from a wolfman and a headband made from a pine twig. As a sign of authority, Sunnhild carries a shaman's staff that is rumored to
		enhance her magical powers.

			Sunnhild came to power by using her status as a shaman to gather a core of loyal supports before convincing the other shamans that
			having a shaman in charge would be a better way to guide the Gunda tribe on the
			<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-rauber-tribes">Rauber</a> path. Through further political maneuvering, Sunnhild was able to find a time
			where the prior chieftain had only four guards with him, during which she challenged him to a duel with her full force.

			Being far from the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a>, Sunnhild recognizes that her tribe has little experience with their
			capabilities and limitations, and wishes to use probing actions and a careful, measured approach to take down the
			<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a>, as she is certain that none of the other
