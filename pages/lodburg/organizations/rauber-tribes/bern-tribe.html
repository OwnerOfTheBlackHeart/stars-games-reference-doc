<h1>The Bern Tribe</h1>
<p>
	Claiming the Briarfield, from the eastern side of the Splitmarch to the Farwalk Pass, the Bern Tribe is one of the best positioned of the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-rauber-tribes">Rauber tribes</a>, having the north and western roads to
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-thornhost">Thornhost</a> within their territory. Despite their good position for attacking the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a>, the Bern Tribe is cautious when attacking travelers on the roads, as prior attacks on the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> have worn down their numbers.
</p>

<p>
	The current chieftain of the Bern Tribe is <a href="#detlev-bern">Detlev Bern</a>, an elder who was a viking for over 40 years, but is now
	entrusted to prevent the death of the tribe.

		Detlev is a 5' 9", male human with unkempt, shoulder-length gray hair, a thick, matching beard, ice blue eyes and light skin. Detlev's
		aging body is as heavily scared as his face is wrinkled. Detlev wears a metal breastplate with a thick, reindeer hide kilt. An axe rests
		on his back, held in place by a holster of chains.

			Detlev served the Bern Tribe as a viking and a hunter for over 40 years, gaining the respect of his tribe in the process. As the raids
			against the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> and the resultant <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> counterattacks
			resulted in steadily increasing casualties, the Bern Tribe turned to their eldest viking, which over time slowly became Detlev.

			Detlev's time among the Bern Tribe as a viking has caused him to see many friends, his brother, father, and two of his daughters die
			at the hands of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a>. Due to this loss of those dear to him, Detlev wishes to cease the
			death of his people, and views ceasing the attacks on the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> as the easiest way to do this.
		</p>
		<p>
			Though Detlev favors the idea of ceasing hostilities with the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a>, he is far from their
			friend. He is more than happy to blame them for the loss of much of his family and for forcing his people into exile within land that
			he believes they have the right to.
