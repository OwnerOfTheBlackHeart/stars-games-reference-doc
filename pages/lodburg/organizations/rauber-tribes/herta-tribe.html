<h1>The Herta Tribe</h1>
<p>
	Claiming the western side of the Splitmarch to the edge of the Hoarfrost Reach, the Herta tribe is a constant thorn in the side of
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-direwater">Direwater</a>, unknowingly exploiting the tension between the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> and the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-wabril">Wabril</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The current chieftain of the Herta Tribe is <a href="#gerlach-herta">Gerlach Herta</a>, a brave warrior who managed to infiltrate
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-thornhost">Thornhost</a> and commission himself a "noble's" weapon.

		<p>
			A skilled and brave viking of the Herta Tribe, Gerlach made a name for himself by capturing several
			<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> traders and forcing them to teach him <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a>, after
			which he killed them and used their clothes and their silver to enter <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-thornhost">Thornhost</a> and
			commission himself the most expensive weapon he could manage, which he used upon his return to rally allies and kill the prior
			chieftain.

			Viewing the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> as weak and soft after his visit to
			<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-thornhost">Thornhost</a>, Gerlach believes that the best way to deal with the
			<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> is to attack quickly, taking out their power centers before they have a chance to realize
			what is happening and harden as a people. After that, it would be a "simple" matter of hunting down any surviving
			<a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a>, and fixing the fact that they are still alive.
