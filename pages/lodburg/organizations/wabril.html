	A foreign people recently integrated into the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axon</a> after a series of 3, decade long wars ravaged
	the Georgiy Empire and displaced them across the globe. While <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axons</a> are willing to give individual
	wabril a chance, the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">Axons</a> view their people, as a whole, as trouble, in no part to the reputation
	of the Wabril in the Georgiy Empire, as a people neurotically driven to break laws. In an effort to separate themselves from the stigmas,
	many a wabril will take on <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-axon">axon</a> names.

	Common physical traits among the human Wabril include small ears, yellow, orange or red eyes, shiny hair that ranges from white to black
	and yellow-brown skin. The dragonfolk Wabril commonly have dull scales, long, narrow snouts, thick torsos and are warm to the touch.
