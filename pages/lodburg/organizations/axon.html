	Having moved in roughly 100 years ago, according to their calendars, the Axon took Lodburg through a mix of stealth and force, pushing the
	Rauber inland.

	While they were originally a patriarchy, the demands of constant fishing, hunting and foraging drew the men away from the homes, leaving
	women and the elderly in the settlements. This slowly lead to the Axon becoming matrilineal (tracing ownership through the female line),
	though the presence of elder men prevented the full evolution of a matriarchy. In the present day, men mostly perform work that takes them
	out of their cities and villages, while the women run the settlements, serve as guards, and perform most of the duties necessary for the
	day to day operations of a settlement, while a Council of Elders serve as the "leadership" of a settlement.

	Most Axon buildings are built during Rasputitsa, or the thawing season, when the first one to three feet of ground thaws and turns to mud.
	During this time, they excavate a section of the soft, muddy soil while placing stones, wooden planks, or timber into the hole to serve as
	foundations. After then completely clearing the hole and adding a floor, a section of mud and a second, inner foundation is added to
	provide extra strength, after which a roof is built, typically out of rough timber, then covered over with thick mud. Once the process is
	complete, the resulting building is well insulated and mostly underground, with only a mound a few feet tall giving the building away,
	except for the entrance building, which is designed to allow access, even during Rasputitsa. Larger families, or more influential
	individuals, may have homes with more, or deeper, rooms, while most families only have a single room in their home. The largest of these
	buildings can seem like labyrinths within.
