	Having moved in roughly 100 years ago, according to their calendars, the Axon took Lodburg through a mix of stealth and force, pushing the
	Rauber inland.
</p>
<p>
	While they were originally a patriarchy, the demands of constant fishing, hunting and foraging drew the men away from the homes, leaving
	women and the elderly in the settlements. This slowly lead to the Axon becoming matrilineal (tracing ownership through the female line),
	though the presence of elder men prevented the full evolution of a matriarchy. In the present day, men mostly perform work that takes them
	out of their cities and villages, while the women run the settlements, serve as guards, and perform most of the duties necessary for the
	day to day operations of a settlement, while a Council of Elders serve as the "leadership" of a settlement.

	Most Axon buildings are built during Rasputitsa, or the thawing season, when the first one to three feet of ground thaws and turns to mud.
	During this time, they excavate a section of the soft, muddy soil while placing stones, wooden planks, or timber into the hole to serve as
	foundations. After then completely clearing the hole and adding a floor, a section of mud and a second, inner foundation is added to
	provide extra strength, after which a roof is built, typically out of rough timber, then covered over with thick mud. Once the process is
	complete, the resulting building is well insulated and mostly underground, with only a mound a few feet tall giving the building away,
	except for the entrance building, which is designed to allow access, even during Rasputitsa. Larger families, or more influential
	individuals, may have homes with more, or deeper, rooms, while most families only have a single room in their home. The largest of these
	buildings can seem like labyrinths within.

<h2 id="leadership-positions">Leadership Positions</h2>
<p>
	Due to the fact that Axon culture highly encourages men to handle the jobs that take them outside of Axon settlements, titles are held by
	women, baring the title of <a href="#jonlaat">jonlaat</a> and extreme circumstances. Hereditary titles among the Axon are passed from
	mother to eldest daughter, upon the death or retirement of the mother.
</p>

<h3 id="council-of-elders">Council of Elders</h3>
<p>
	Every Axon settlement has a Council of Elders ranging from 4 to 24 <a href="#elder">elders</a>, depending on the size of the settlement.
	The purpose of a Council of Elders is to enact and repeal laws, declare war, and handle the distribution of public funding. In order for a
	Council of Elders to be able to vote on an issue, at least half of the <a href="#elder">elders</a> must be present.
</p>
<p>
	Most Councils of Elders require a simple majority vote for any issue to be considered passed, but some stricter Councils require a three
	quarters vote, while others, particularly very small Councils, require a unanimous vote.
</p>

<h4 id="elder">Elder</h4>
<p>
	To be legally called an elder, an Axon must be a member of a <a href="#council-of-elders">Council of Elders</a>. As an elder, an Axon has
	the ability to vote on issues brought before the <a href="#council-of-elders">Council of Elders</a>, though the actual power comes from
	the influence of the title and the closeness to the <a href="#chair-of-the-council-of-elders">Chair of the Council of Elders</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Elders are pulled from the pool of persons too old or injured to be able to perform manual labor or military service and, in theory, any
	Axon that has lived long enough has a chance at becoming an elder. In reality, <a href="#jonlaat">jonlaats</a> and women of "noble title"
	have a far greater chance at becoming an elder due to their prior positions of leadership.
</p>

<h4 id="chair-of-the-council-of-elders">Chair of the Council of Elders</h4>
<p>
	Normally referred to as the Chairman or Chairwoman, the Chair of the Council of Elders is an <a href="#elder">elder</a> appointed to be in
	charge of managing a <a href="#council-of-elders">Council of Elders</a>. The Chair has two main responsibilities: To call their
	<a href="#council-of-elders">Council of Elders</a> to meet and to choose which topics their <a href="#council-of-elders">council</a> votes
	on. When necessary, a Chair can also make "short-term" decisions that stand until the next time that their
	<a href="#council-of-elders">Council of Elders</a> meets, during which any short-term decisions will be voted on before any other issues.
</p>
<p>Chairs of the Councils of Elders are elected by the <a href="#council-of-grand-elders">Council of Grand Elders</a>.</p>

<h3 id="council-of-grand-elders">Council of Grand Elders</h3>
<p>
	A rarely meeting council based in <a is="ap-nav-link" href="lod-thornhost">The City of Thornhost</a>, the Council of Grand Elders is in
	charge of electing <a href="#chair-of-the-council-of-elders">chairs</a> of the lower <a href="#council-of-elders">councils</a>, though the
	Council of Grand Elders has the authority to pass laws that, in theory, apply to all Axons. The Grand Elders of the Council of Grand
	Elders are elected from by the <a href="#council-of-elders">Councils of Elders</a> of any Axon settlement larger than a village, with each
	such settlement having one Grand Elder. As the Grand Elders are normally serving their own settlements, the Council of the Grand Elders
	traditionally meets once a year at the end of rasputitsa.
</p>

<h3 id="laname">Laname</h3>
<p>
	Assigned by a settlement's <a href="#council-of-elders">Council of Elders</a>, a laname is in charge of collecting taxes, or managing tax
	collectors in large settlements, managing the local guard force, and assigning land ownership within their settlement. While a laname is
	not required to collect more taxes than is required to meet the <a href="#council-of-elders">Council of Elders</a> budget and the cost of
	maintaining the settlement's guards, lanames overtax their holdings and live off of the excess taxes, though sudden updates to the
	<a href="#council-of-elders">Council of Elders'</a> budget can force them to give up a portion of their personal funds.
</p>

<h3 id="frulaat">Frulaat</h3>
<p>
	Granted their title by a <a href="#chair-of-the-council-of-elders">Chair of the Council of Elders</a>, frulaats are in charge of taxing,
	protecting, and enforcing law and order within their lands, as well as maintaining militias and conscript armies (when they are needed).
	Compared to the title <a href="#laname">laname</a>, frulaats watch over larger amounts of territory, whether a collection of minor
	settlements or a patch of barely civilized land. Another notable difference is that the title of frulaat is hereditary, while
	<a href="#laname">laname</a> is not.
</p>
<p>When the military forces of a frulaat are called to arms, the frulaat, or one of the frulaat's children, is expected to lead them.</p>
<p>
	The children of a frulaat, upon reaching puberty, must serve their <a href="#council-of-elders">Council of Elders</a> for 4 years, if
	male, or 6 years, if female. During this time, they personally serve and protect the <a href="#elder">elders</a>, though this is as much
	service as it is training. Under ideal conditions, the children learn law, battle, tactics, military leadership, and, should the
	<a href="#elder">elder</a> they serve care about such things, honor. The extra 2 years that daughters serve their
	<a href="#council-of-elders">council</a> allows for the potential future frulaats to be given specific training in their job, such as tax
	tracking and collection, financial/asset management and civil leadership.
</p>

<h4 id="jonlaat">Jonlaat</h4>
<p>
	Upon finishing their service under their <a href="#council-of-elders">Council of Elders</a>, sons of
	<a href="#frulaat">frulaats</a> become jonlaats. Jonlaats are responsible for providing security and leadership to the men of their
	mother's territory when they are out of the home, often managing small guard garrisons at hunting and fishing camps, and tracking and
	directing other men as to where to hunt, fish, lumber, and mine.
</p>
<p>While a jonlaat is a jonlaat for life, they do not pass their title on to their progeny.</p>

<h4 id="fruchter">Fruchter</h4>
<p>
	Upon finishing their service under their <a href="#council-of-elders">Council of Elders</a>, daughters of
	<a href="#frulaat">frulaats</a> become fruchters. While a noble title, fruchter on its own comes with no special powers or
	responsibilities, though the connections that fruchters have from their families and service to their
	<a href="#council-of-elders">Council of Elders</a> make it far easier for a fruchter to gain land and title than a normal Axon woman.
</p>

<h3 id="sywacht">Sywacht</h3>
<p>
	Granted their title by the <a href="#council-of-grand-elders">Council of Grand Elders</a>, sywachts are in charge of operating major
	fortifications, such as castles or isolated forts. A sywacht has all the powers and responsibilities of a
	<a href="#frulaat">frulaat</a> over the minor settlements that surround and support their fortification. Much like the title of
	<a href="#frulaat">frulaat</a>, the title of sywacht is hereditary.
</p>
<p>
	The children of a sywacht are required to go through the same service as the children of <a href="#frulaat">frulaats</a>, with male
	children gaining the same title of <a href="#jonlaat">jonlaat</a> and female children gaining the same title of
	<a href="#fruchter">fruchter</a>.
</p>
<p>
	If an Axon builds, or otherwise acquires, a fort or castle, and requests a title from the
	<a href="#council-of-grand-elders">Council of Grand Elders</a>, it is likely that they will be granted the title at the
	<a href="#council-of-grand-elders">Council of Grand Elders'</a> next meeting.
