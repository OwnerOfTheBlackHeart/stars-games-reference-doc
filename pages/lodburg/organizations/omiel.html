		Having crashed their mothership in the Lodburg roughly 300 years ago, the Om'iel are a race of aliens "adapting" to the Lodburg rather
		well. While their exact motivations are unknown, the Om'iel have constructed a pair of signal pillars and a portal to a land unknown,
		created a small handful of monsters and turned the wreckage of their mothership into a functioning "settlement".

		The Om'iel themselves resemble typical grays, standing 5 to 7 feet tall with oversized heads and eyes, no nose, and stretched bodies and
		limbs. Om'iel are rarely found outside their protective suits of armor and typically carry some kind of strange "wand" (energy weapon).
		The Om'iel also posses strange mind powers, though the exact expression varies depending on how the individual om'iel was taught to use
		them.
