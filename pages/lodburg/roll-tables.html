	<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Fae</span></li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Fae are a type of natural spirit that possess powerful magic (at least by relative standards) and are innately connected, and born
			from, some natural feature. Most fae cannot survive away from the natural feature which spawns them for more than a few hours, during
			which their power slowly wanes until they no longer have enough energy to survive.
		</li>
		<li>Giants</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Gaints are as big as the mountains they are born from, only decending from their mountain homes to gather materials, often whatever
				animal smaller than them they can catch, including humanoids, for food
			</li>
			<li>Cyclops</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A solitary, one eyed variant of gaints, cyclopses are smaller and weaker than normal giants, though they are more active hunters
					and can survive for up to 2 days away from their mountain homes.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Troll</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Even smaller than the cyclops, trolls are a dull, pack-hunting species of giant that lives in the high valleys between mountain
					peaks. They are the most active form of gaints, though if they are caught out in the light of the sun, they will turn to stone.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>Snow faeries</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The most common form of fae in Lodburg, snow faeries are as beautiful and cold as the winter storms that spawn them and the snow
				falls that keep them alive. During&nbsp;rasputitsa, snow faeries hoard as much snow as they can into the hollows underneat great
				trees and in other places hidden from the heat of the sun and the threat of those who would hunt them during this time of weakness.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Elves</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The "mortal" fae, elves are the most adaptive fae and the only ones to be able to leave their home environment and survive. Elves
				reproduce like mortals, with the environment they are born in determining the type of elf they are. Elves that do not die of
				violence, starvation or magical disease can expect to live around 1,000 years.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Fae Creations</span></li>
	<ul>
		<li><span style="font-style: italic">Beastmen</span></li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Beastmen are twisted creations created by the fae, being little more than animals forced to stand on their hind legs, have their
				forelimbs sprout hands at the end, and have their necks adjusted to their vertical stance.
			</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Beastmen are more like skinwalkers than werebeasts</li>
				<li>Because their bodies aren't truly designed for bipedal movement, beastmen suffer many long-term spinal issues</li>
				<li>Most beastmen&nbsp;are only slightly smarter than the animal they once were, though some have developed to a human level</li>
				<li>
					Beastmen speak fae as well as beastfolk, a derivative language of fae that the beastmen prefer. Speaking to beastmen in fae will
					make them immediately wary of an individual.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Beastmen come in the following varieties:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Foxfolk</li>
				<li>Wolfmen</li>
				<li>Bearmen</li>
				<li>Eaglemen</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Unlike the other forms of beastmen, eaglemen do not have a paw to have a hand replace. Instead, hands sprout from the eaglemen's
						wrists, coming out from the middle, front of the wings. The hands are scaled and clawed like the feet of the eagle.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Wolverinefolk</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
