		Artax asks <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele-contacts#jaime-leoz">Unifier Leoz</a> if he has any work for her.
		<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele-contacts#jaime-leoz">Unifier Leoz</a> informs Artax that he is concerned about the sudden expansion
		of <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a>, and the openness with which they have been conducting their rituals.
	</li>
	<li>
		Artax begins searching for/researching <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a>:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Artax rolls a connect roll:
				<ul>
					<li>
						A roll of 6, or higher, will reveal the nearest <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a>
						congregation.
					</li>
					<li>
						A roll of 7, or higher, will inform Artax about the special <a href="#manera-verdadera">Juice</a> that
						<a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a> is using and the general beliefs of
						<a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						A roll of 8, or higher, will inform Artax about the fact that <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a>
						has recently gained a strong financial backer.
					</li>
					<li>
						A roll of 10, or higher, will inform Artax that a group called <a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Women Again</a> has recently started
						backing <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a>.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Artax rolls a program roll:
				<ul>
					<li>A roll of 6, or higher, will reveal the the general beliefs of <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a>.</li>
					<li>
						A roll of 7, or higher, will reveal the special <a href="#manera-verdadera">Juice</a> that
						<a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a> is using and the fact that <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a>
						has recently gained a strong financial backer.
					</li>
					<li>A roll of 8, or higher, will reveal that <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a> is a peaceful organization.</li>
					<li>
						A roll of 9, or higher, will reveal the nearest <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a>
						congregation.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Artax rolls an administer roll:
				<ul>
					<li>
						A roll of 7, or higher, will inform Artax that a group called <a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Women Again</a> has recently started
						backing <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						A roll of 8, or higher, will reveal that <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a> hasn't committed any crimes other than
						illegally preaching in public.
					</li>
					<li>
						A roll of 9, or higher, will reveal that <a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Women Again</a> has been receiving unmarked shipments
						under the name <a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Zhenshchiny Snova</a>.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Artax rolls a know roll:
				<ul>
					<li>
						A roll of 6, or higher, will reveal that single expression sects, like <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a>, pop up
						every now and again, but rarely gain much traction.
					</li>
					<li>
						A roll of 8, or higher, will reveal that <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a> is special because they are the first
						to find a way to modify the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church#the-juice">Juice</a>, effectively doubling their
						audience and allowing them to piggyback off of existing
						<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a> orthodoxy to more effectively push recruitment.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Artax tracks down the local <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a> congregation:
		<ul>
			<li>
				The congregation meets at a bomb crater turned ampitheater which uses some abandoned, but still standing, houses as storage. The
				ampitheater is well made, but the structure is clearly cheap and easily replaceable, with anything of value stored when not in use.
				The ampitheater has seating for about 300 people, though only about half of the seats are filled.
			</li>
			<li>
				The congregation is more than happy to accept Artax, perhaps even excited at the prospect of gaining the support of a paladin. A
				talk/wisdom or notice/cha check of 8, or better, will reveal that they are excited because a priest of the
				<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a> joining can be seen as validating
				<a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a> as a sect of the
				<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				The congregation is led by a woman named Inez Carderas. Inez is a 5' 1" feminine herm with caramel skin, D cup titties, long curly
				black hair, bright gold eyes and a svelte, almost anorexic, build. When with the congregation, she normally wears a yellow, green
				and pink pulpit gown with heavy jewelry. Inez has a 6" dick and an attractiveness of 10.
			</li>
			<li>
				A <a href="#zhennova-agent">zhennova agent</a> by the name of Yelena Ortov is present at the congregation. Yelena is a 5' 8"
				feminine herm with pale skin, D cup titties, shoulder length brown hair kept in a ponytail, blue-green eyes, and an average build.
				Yelena has a 6" dick and an attractiveness of 8.
			</li>
			<li>
				Investigating the storage areas can reveal that the local <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a> congregation is being
				funded by <a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Zhennova</a>, as well as the location of the <a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Zhennova</a> base.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Artax tracks down the location of <a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Zhennova</a>:
		<ul>
			<li>
				The <a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Zhennova</a> base is located in an abandoned
				<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-united-counties-of-polla">pollan</a> forward operating base. Of the base's 2 towers, only 1 remains,
				while the barracks and command building appear to have weathered time unharmed, but the garage has been completely rebuilt, now far
				smaller than the concrete pad it's built on top of. What looks to be the armory is a bank truck parked next to
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quonset_hut" target="_blank">Quonset hut</a> marked maintenance. The wall surrounding the
				base has been repaired, but lacks barbed wire.
			</li>
			<li>
				The base is staffed with 7 fireteams broken down into the following:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b><i>Garage:</i></b> 2 <a href="#zhennova-soldier">zhennova soldiers</a> and 3
						<a href="#zhennova-slave-warrior">zhennova slave warriors</a>, plus 2 <a href="#conesse-technical">conesse technicals</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><i>Barracks:</i></b> 3 <a href="#zhennova-soldier">zhennova soldiers</a> and 4
						<a href="#zhennova-slave-warrior">zhennova slave warriors</a>.
					</li>
					<li>

						<a href="#zhennova-slave-warrior">zhennova slave warriors</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><i>Guarding the Armory:</i></b> 4 <a href="#zhennova-soldier">zhennova soldiers</a> and 6
						<a href="#zhennova-slave-warrior">zhennova slave warriors</a> guarding the building. Inside houses Kapitan Katlina Nikitin and
						Anja Volokh. Investigating the command office reveals:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Zhennova</a> has been steadily growing from it's original 10 members, up to the 16 current
								members
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Zhennova</a> knew that it, at it's current size, didn't pose a threat to
								<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#la-contillo">La Contillo</a> at their current size, but plans are laid for operations
								intended to drive recruitment, damage <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#la-contillo">La Contillo's</a> ability to respond,
								and make full use of <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-peoples-republic-of-cono">conesse</a> support to create an environment
								for eventual <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-peoples-republic-of-cono">conesse</a> reinforcements.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Zhennova</a> has been supplied by a small naval task force lead by a
								<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele-enemies#olena-gurov">Kovnik</a> Gurov.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><i>In the Tower:</i></b> 1 <a href="#zhennova-soldier">zhennova soldier</a> with a rifle and 4
						<a href="#zhennova-slave-warrior">zhennova slave warriors</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><i>Patrol 1:</i></b> 1 <a href="#zhennova-soldier">zhennova soldiers</a> and 4
						<a href="#zhennova-slave-warrior">zhennova slave warriors</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><i>Patrol 2:</i></b> 2 <a href="#zhennova-soldier">zhennova soldiers</a> and 4
						<a href="#zhennova-slave-warrior">zhennova slave warriors</a>.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				The "kapitan" of the base is Katlina Nikitin, a <a href="#zhennova-soldier">zhennova soldier</a> with 3 hit dice, +3 to hit, +1 to
				damage and a morale of 9. Katlina is a 5' 9" feminine hermaphrodite with pale white skin, E (DD) cup titties, short, blonde hair,
				brown eyes, and an athletic build. Katlina has an attractiveness of 9.
			</li>
			<li>
				The base also houses Anja Volokh, a <a href="#conesse-bvb-agent">conesse BVB agent</a>. She is a 5' 8" female with tanned-yellow
				skin, B cup titties, a reddish-brown mullet with braided bangs that frame her face, silver eyes, and an average build. Anja has an
				attractiveness of 10.
			</li>
		</ul>

		Artax returns to <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele-contacts#jaime-leoz">Unifier Leoz</a> to report on the situation and get paid.

<!-- <h4 id="manera-verdadera">The Manera Verdadera Movement</h4>
<p>
	The Manera Verdadera movement is a religious reformist group within the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a> that has discovered how to update the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church#the-juice">Juice</a> to perform a more aggressive transformation, turning all in it into
	feminine hermaphrodites, which the Manera Verdadera believe is the ultimate for of being Unified.
</p>
<p>
	The Manera Verdadera movement is expanding rapidly at the current moment, and is readily sharing both information on how to make their
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church#the-juice">Juice</a> and encouragement to join in their mass induction ceremonies. A
	partial cause of the popularity is the fact that their <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church#the-juice">Juice</a> has a chance to
	make someone more beautiful and/or well endowed, allowing the recipient to reroll all sexual and attractiveness characteristics, taking
	the higher of their current roll or the reroll. Major monetary donations from <a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Women Again</a> hasn't hurt
	either.

	<p>
		Chelke earned her title as the Devourer of Galssop for single handedly destroying the town of Galssop at the beginning of her attacks on
		Uhan. The town of Galssop was on the northwestern edge of Uhan, from which Chelke carved a path of destruction to the southeast, until
		Seki's intervention forcing Chelke to run to Lodburg to avoid retribution at the hand of the gods.
