<h1>Team Size Rules</h1>
<p>
	While in prior games the party has been able to mass their full power led to encounters being difficult to work with, sluggish in play,
	and often times boring, with certain PCs and NPCs rarely getting much use, this rule set is designed to encourage smaller unit play and
	the rotation of NPCs.

<h2 id="important-terms">Important Terms</h2>
<p>
	<i class="item-name" id="characters">Characters</i> are any character or creature present in the game, including player characters,
	sheeted characters, NPCs, remotely controlled drones, enemies, etc.
</p>
<p>
	<i class="item-name" id="player-character">Player characters</i> are any characters directly controlled by a player. In the vast majority
	of players have only one player character in a campaign. All player characters are also sheeted characters.
</p>
<p>
	<i class="item-name" id="sheeted-characters">Sheeted characters</i> are any character with a player character sheet, though they can be
	NPCs, or even enemies.
</p>
<p>
	<i class="item-name" id="npcs">NPCs</i>, or non-player characters, are any character that is not directly controlled by a player. NPCs can
	be enemies, GM controlled characters, or characters that are passed around between characters. Unless specified as sheeted characters,
	NPCs use NPC stat blocks.
</p>
<p>
	<i class="item-name" id="externally-controlled-drones">Externally controlled drones</i> are drones that are not controlled by a member of
	the team. They may be controlled via the drone control homebrew rules or via long distance control. Drones that utilize expert systems to
	get around a character's maximum drone count fall into this category.
</p>

<h2 id="teams">Teams</h2>
<p>
	The basis of these rules is the team: A group of up to 4 characters of any variety with 2 possible auxillary NPCs/externally controlled
	drones. When deploying for a mission, a team may select 1, or more, objectives or locations that are under their purview. Each objective
	or location has a limited number of teams that can deploy to it, a maximum of 1 team unless otherwise stated. The exact characters that
	make up a team need not be determined until the team deploys.
</p>
<p>
	While teams have a limited size, the number of teams deployed is only limited by the capacity for characters to be transported, with
	"standby" teams able to be kept in reserve in case another team dies or needs to retreat from their location or objective. If no "standby"
	teams are in place when a team dies or retreats, other active teams can move to the objective or location that has lost its team.

<p>
	Every character that isn't a player character has a fatigue score. By default, this score is 0 and has a maximum value of 10. Every
	mission that a character participates in, they gain 1 fatigue, regardless of the result. If the mission is failed, all characters involved
	gain an extra 1 fatigue. A character will slowly build up increasingly severe penalties as they grow more fatigued. To determine the
	penalties for the given level of fatigue, refer to the table to left.
</p>
<p>
	A character loses fatigue at a rate of 1 per 2 weeks (14 days) after they last received fatigue. In dire situations, a character can burn
	a fatigue by spending a day giving in to their vices, taking 24 hours, 50 credits per character level and taking 1d3 system strain.
