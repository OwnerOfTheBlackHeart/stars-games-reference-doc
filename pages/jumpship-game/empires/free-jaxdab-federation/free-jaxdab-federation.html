<h1>Free Jaxdab Federation</h1>
<p>
	The Free Jaxdab Federation, ruled from it's capital on <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-thurid">Thurid</a>, is a loose federation of planets
	that are "willingly" united in trade and space defense. <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-thurid">Thurid</a> remains the most influential of
	the planets in the Federation thanks to its technological advantage and higher population, which the local Exchange Consulate isn't afraid
	to use deniable operations to ensure it maintains.
</p>
<p>
	The Free Jaxdab Federation generally ignores the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-thurid">Peoples' Republic of Salmy</a> as the nearest
	planet, <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ambee">Ambee</a>, isn't valuable enough to draw the attention of
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-thurid">Thurid</a>. Meanwhile, the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-noxpaj-alliance">Nox'paj Alliance</a> is
	viewed as a threat and their planet of <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-lorne-maie">Lorne Maie</a> is viewed as a desired prize by
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-thurid">Thurid</a>.
