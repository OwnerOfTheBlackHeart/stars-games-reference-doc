<p>
	The Free Jaxdab Federation, ruled from it's capital on <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-thurid">Thurid</a>, is a loose federation of planets
	that are "willingly" united in trade and space defense. <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-thurid">Thurid</a> remains the most influential of
	the planets in the Federation thanks to its technological advantage and higher population, which the local Exchange Consulate isn't afraid
	to use deniable operations to ensure it maintains.
</p>
<p>
	The Free Jaxdab Federation generally ignores the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-thurid">Peoples' Republic of Salmy</a> as the nearest
	planet, <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ambee">Ambee</a>, isn't valuable enough to draw the attention of
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-thurid">Thurid</a>. Meanwhile, the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-noxpaj-alliance">Nox'paj Alliance</a> is
	viewed as a threat and their planet of <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-lorne-maie">Lorne Maie</a> is viewed as a desired prize by
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-thurid">Thurid</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Nobility from <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-thurid">Thurid</a> use mechs as a symbol of status, one which only nobles have access to,
	save those who have adequately impressed a noble of high enough status. While this quirk would normally be of little effect to most,
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-thurid">thuridian</a> nobles are common alongside Exchange Consulate diplomats in helping to maintain
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-thurid">Thurid's</a> supremacy and monitor the lesser planets and nations within the Federation. For
	historical and traditional reasons, it is rare for male nobles to own or be trained in the use of mechs. Having a daughter who owns a
	heavy mech filled with advanced technology is a sign of supreme wealth and influence, and a massive mark of pride direct relatives can
	lord over other noble houses.
