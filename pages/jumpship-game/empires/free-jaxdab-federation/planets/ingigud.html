	The planet of Ingigud is a temperate world, with tropical islands to polar ice caps, covered in a generally nonreactive, but toxic to
	humans, atmosphere that can be countered with a simple filter mask. Due to the thick atmosphere, caused by a strong magnetic field
	suspending aerosolized ferromagnetic material, a constant light fog of roughly silver color, though particularly dense pockets can be
	become sharply silver or red in appearance, often interfering with visual, thermal and radio sensors. Most of the plants and animals
	present on Ingigud are perfectly edible, though one has to be careful of any filtering organs as they can cause rapid metal poisoning when
	ingested.
</p>
<p>
	Ingigud has two main continents, <a href="#aiga">Aiga</a> and <a href="#galuga">Galuga</a>, and many small islands scattered about a
	reasonably large ocean.
</p>
<p>
	The "planetary government" of Ingigud is a member of the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-free-jaxdab-federation">Free Jaxdab Federation</a>, if only because they felt joining the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-free-jaxdab-federation">Federation</a> to be a safer bet than attempting to resist their numbers.
</p>
<p>
	The two major settlements of Ingigud, <a href="#tagata">Tagata</a> and <a href="#komunisi">Komunisi</a>, are currently at war, with
	<a href="#komunisi">Komunisi</a> claiming that the Eyebot government needs to be forcefully overthrown so that the citizens of
	<a href="#tagata">Tagata</a> can experience glorious socialism provided by labor robots.
</p>

<h3 id="aiga">Aiga</h3>
<p>
	Aiga is the larger of the two continents, spreading out in all directions from the equator and nearly reaching the southern polar ice cap,
	though only to about the sub-tropical region to the north of the equator. The "cities" of <a href="#tagata">Tagata</a> and
	<a href="#komunisi">Komunisi</a> are the only population centers holding more than 10,000 people, with each having nearly 200,000
	citizens. <a href="#tagata">Tagata</a> is located near the equator, namely for the optimal spacecraft launching position, while
	<a href="#komunisi">Komunisi</a> is located in the southern temperate band, positioned for the best for extracting natural resources.
	<a href="#tagata">Tagata</a> and <a href="#komunisi">Komunisi</a> are around 2,500 miles, or 4,150 kilometers, apart, taking about 4.5
	hours by plane or 36 hours by freeway to travel between.
</p>

<h4 id="komunisi">Komunisi</h4>
<p>
	A nearly true socialist settlement thanks to the heavy use of robots providing plenty of resources to its citizens, the only real
	complaints that most citizens have is that The Footage no longer releases new episodes and that housing within the city is cramped. The
	vast majority of the population works as bot wranglers and mechanics, while the "educated" citizens work in government, the sciences, and
	robot design, while those who don't perform any of the previous jobs are normally artists of some variety.
</p>
<p>
	Komunisi has been waging a brutal war with <a href="#tagata">Tagata</a>, as they believe that the Eyebots' unrepentant capitalism is
	preventing the tagatan citizens from realizing the greatness of robotically provided communism.

		The Eyebots are secretly experimenting with maltech, ranging from slave clones to "mass marketable" planet killers. In order to prevent
		the Eyebots from realizing that the Battlebots are aware of this, the Battlebots have chosen to instead fuel support for the war using
		the fact that the Eyebots are "capitalists in need of immediate guidance".
	</p>
</ap-auth-container>
<p>
	The city government and Taugofie Robotics are called the Battlebots by the citizens, as that is the name used for their "team" in The
	Footage. In both The Demonstrations and in war, the Battlebots prefer more expensive and more capable robots.
</p>

<h4 id="tagata">Tagata</h4>
<p>
	A "capitalist utopia" where the rich live lavish lives and any sufficiently driven, and/or skilled, poor can reach the class just below
	the super rich, who buy out everyone else before their wealth is threatened. About 50% of the citizens live in a Kowloon Walled City like
	building known as The Cube, while the rest live in homes ranging from suburbia to private mansions. Rampant consumerism is encouraged in
	Tagata, by both the media and the elite, who are all the more happy to trick the common man into buying them a new yacht.
</p>
<p>
	The city government and military industrial complex of Tagata, including Fana-Suni Heavy Industries, are commonly referred to as the
	Eyebots by the citizens, as that is the name used for their "team" in The Footage. The Eyebots primarily use cheap and fast floating
	robots with limited individual combat capability, the eyebot model being where their name comes from, for The Demonstrations and war.
	Eyebots and their kin are designed to work in larger groups, sometimes with a single, expensive coordinator bot managing whole platoons.

<h3 id="galuga">Galuga</h3>
<p>
	Galuga is the northern continent and is made up primarily of large islands that are very sparsely inhabited, with the few residents being
	hermits. The islands themselves see use as automated outposts, dedicated battlefields, or nature preserves. The island of Taua is notable
	for having been the location of choice for the historic triennial battles between Taugofie Robotics and Fana-Suni Heavy Industries, known
	as The Demonstrations, where the two companies deployed large numbers of progressively iterated robots to display to their innovation,
	skill, adaptability and quality to their settlement's militaries, as well as their civilian customers. A television show called The
	Footage compiled all the battle footage and produced 78 episodes (3 years of an episode every other week) of sports-like footage from each
	Demonstrations, with people rooting for their favorite platoon. The Demonstrations have been on hiatus for nearly 2 decades, though reruns
	of The Footage run regularly.
