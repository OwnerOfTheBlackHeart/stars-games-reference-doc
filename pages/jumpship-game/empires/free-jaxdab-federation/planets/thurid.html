<p>
	The capital of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-free-jaxdab-federation">Free Jaxdab Federation</a>, Thurid is a heavily populated,
	Earth-like world with plentiful resources of all types, save food. The comfortable living conditions of the world and the abundance of the
	planet have caused the population to boom well beyond what the initial terraforming crops can handle feeding. As such, the people of
	Thurid have turned to a product readily available both locally and from other worlds to supplement their diets: Corpse starch.
</p>
<p>
	Thurid also maintains a branch of the Exchange of Light, a powerful force of diplomacy and banking that provides Thurid with a major
	weapon to use to control the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-free-jaxdab-federation">Free Jaxdab Federation</a> and its member systems.
</p>
<p>
	The planet itself is mostly water with two super continents: Xanth and Iloria. Both Xanth and Iloria contain a large number of biomes and
	terrains, Xanth has a slightly larger population while Iloria has more mountains and is more heavily exploited for rare Earth minerals.
</p>
<p>
	Nobility from Thurid use mechs as a symbol of status, one which only nobles have access to, save those who have adequately impressed a
	noble of high enough status. While this quirk would normally be of little effect to most, thuridian nobles are common alongside Exchange
	Consulate diplomats in helping to maintain Thurid's supremacy and monitor the lesser planets and nations within the Federation. For
	historical and traditional reasons, it is rare for male nobles to own or be trained in the use of mechs. Having a daughter who owns a
	heavy mech filled with advanced technology is a sign of supreme wealth and influence, and a massive mark of pride direct relatives can
	lord over other noble houses.
</p>

<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>
<h3 id="xanth">Xanth</h3>
<p>
	The flatter and more populated of Thurid's two super continents, Xanth also has a greater volume of islands spread about its equatorial
	coast. Farming and manufacturing make up the majority of the continent's economic activity while the islands see frequent use as training
	grounds for the powerful military that Thurid maintains.
</p>

<h4 id="talhant">Talhant</h4>
<p>
	Talhant is a coastal city located on the tropical equator of <a href="#xanth">Xanth</a>, built along the Talkhont Canal, a canal that
	travels down the middle of <a href="#xanth">Xanth</a> and allows cargo ships to sail quickly from one side of
	<a href="#xanth">Xanth</a> to the other. The city has a lively, vibrant culture and hosts the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-free-jaxdab-federation">Free Jaxdab Federation's</a>
	headquarters for MEGAcorp.
</p>
<p>
	Talhant has <a href="#xanth">Xanth's</a> primary spaceport, which serves to reinforce the local economy's reliance on tourism and being a
	trading hub.
</p>

<h3 id="iloria">Iloria</h3>
<p>
	The more mountainous and poorer of Thurid's two super continents, Iloria has about 20% more mountains and 10% more deserts than
	<a href="#xanth">Xanth</a>, which causes the continent to see more resource extraction and processing, leading to a lower average income.
	While not poor, the quality of life and income of the typical Ilorian resident is notably behind that of the average Xanthian. The lower
	farmable land and greater concentration of locals whose primary industry is resource extraction lead to Iloria consistently in conflict
	with local paramilitary groups that the planetary government happily uses to test and bloody its military.
</p>

<h4 id="ikeero">Ikeero</h4>
<p>
	Located at the center of <a href="#iloria">Iloria's</a> cargo train network, Ikeero also hosts <a href="#iloria">Iloria's</a> primary
	spaceport. The city is constantly dirty and hosts a strong presence of military forces, police and mercenaries, all fully invested in
	ensuring stability in the local surrounds. Due to the heavy investment in logistics and security, Ikeero is home to a tight clustering of
	refineries and ore storage facilities, all kept well out of the hands of local militias, gangs and terrorists.
</p>
<p>
	MILcorp has its headquarters in Ikeero, which is a mix of military base and corporate campus. MILcorp also maintains its primary factor
	for their light tank fleet in Ikeero.
