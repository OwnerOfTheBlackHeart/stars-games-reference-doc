<p>
	The planet of Alfreyd is a slightly cold word with a calm, temperate equator perfect for human life and large arctic ice sheets where most
	of the planet-bound population actually live. This is because the equator is considered a conservation zone by the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-maximoffian-enclave">Maximoffian Enclave</a> and access outside of a limited number of approved resorts is
	heavily restricted. While most of the native life lives in the conservation zone, there is still plentiful biodiversity in the sub-arctic
	and arctic regions where people live. However, a large portion of the population actually live in space in the system in various space
	stations that are able to exploit materials from asteroids that the government does not restrict, or on the moon
	<a href="#orite">Orite</a> where mining colonies and factories provide most of the goods used on Alfreyd.
</p>
<p>
	While the equatorial region of Alfreyd is made up of moderately sized islands, the sub-arctic regions are made up of large island
	continents roughly the size of Australia with smaller surrounding islands. The arctic regions, reaching into what on Earth would have been
	the sub-arctic are made up of ice sheets with occasional sections of permafrosted ground that can grow enough plant life to sustain the
	occasional roaming mammal. The main continents are <a href="#ort">Ort</a>, <a href="#gebiet">Gebiet</a>, and
	<a href="#bauernhof">Bauernhof</a> in the northern hemisphere and <a href="#sudland">Sudland</a>,
	<a href="#nicht-nach-norden">Nicht Nach Norden</a>, <a href="#sechs">Sechs</a>, and <a href="#sieben">Sieben</a> in the southern
	hemisphere.
</p>
<p>
	The people of Alfreyd have a strong relationship with the local wildlife, easily taming and controlling it, choosing to live in harmony
	rather than as masters... until they have a reason to call upon the beasts they love. Many locals choose to live near bonded wild animals
	or keep trained beasts within their homes as pets, with residences more akin to zoos than homes being viewed as uncommon, but not rare.
</p>
<p>
	The <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-fellowship-of-steel">Fellowship of Steel</a> has holdings on the moon Orite and hunts any potentially
	advanced technology in equal parts to take it for themselves as to keep it out of the hands of the

	leadership.

	The southernmost continent island on Alfreyd that isn't covered under the arctic ice, the southern end of Nicht Nach Norden is covered in

	service nearby settlements and outposts across the southern ice sheets.

<!-- TODO: Figure out continents and the like -->
<!-- <p>
	Ingigud has two main continents, <a href="#aiga">Aiga</a> and <a href="#galuga">Galuga</a>, and many small islands scattered about a
	reasonably large ocean.
</p>
<p>
	The "planetary government" of Ingigud is a member of the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-free-jaxdab-federation">Free Jaxdab Federation</a>, if only because they felt joining the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-free-jaxdab-federation">Federation</a> to be a safer bet than attempting to resist their numbers.
</p>
<p>
	The two major settlements of Ingigud, <a href="#tagata">Tagata</a> and <a href="#komunisi">Komunisi</a>, are currently at war, with
	<a href="#komunisi">Komunisi</a> claiming that the Eyebot government needs to be forcefully overthrown so that the citizens of
	<a href="#tagata">Tagata</a> can experience glorious socialism provided by labor robots.
</p>

<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>
<h3 id="aiga">Aiga</h3>
<p>
	Aiga is the larger of the two continents, spreading out in all directions from the equator and nearly reaching the southern polar ice cap,
	though only to about the sub-tropical region to the north of the equator. The "cities" of <a href="#tagata">Tagata</a> and
	<a href="#komunisi">Komunisi</a> are the only population centers holding more than 10,000 people, with each having nearly 200,000
	citizens. <a href="#tagata">Tagata</a> is located near the equator, namely for the optimal spacecraft launching position, while
	<a href="#komunisi">Komunisi</a> is located in the southern temperate band, positioned for the best for extracting natural resources.
	<a href="#tagata">Tagata</a> and <a href="#komunisi">Komunisi</a> are around 2,500 miles, or 4,150 kilometers, apart, taking about 4.5
	hours by plane or 36 hours by freeway to travel between.
</p>

<h4 id="komunisi">Komunisi</h4>
<p>
	A nearly true socialist settlement thanks to the heavy use of robots providing plenty of resources to its citizens, the only real
	complaints that most citizens have is that The Footage no longer releases new episodes and that housing within the city is cramped. The
	vast majority of the population works as bot wranglers and mechanics, while the "educated" citizens work in government, the sciences, and
	robot design, while those who don't perform any of the previous jobs are normally artists of some variety.
</p>
<p>
	Komunisi has been waging a brutal war with <a href="#tagata">Tagata</a>, as they believe that the Eyebots' unrepentant capitalism is
	preventing the tagatan citizens from realizing the greatness of robotically provided communism.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="jump-full eyebots-secret-dealings cal">
	<p>
		The Eyebots are secretly experimenting with maltech, ranging from slave clones to "mass marketable" planet killers. In order to prevent
		the Eyebots from realizing that the Battlebots are aware of this, the Battlebots have chosen to instead fuel support for the war using
		the fact that the Eyebots are "capitalists in need of immediate guidance".
	</p>
</ap-auth-container>
<p>
	The city government and Taugofie Robotics are called the Battlebots by the citizens, as that is the name used for their "team" in The
	Footage. In both The Demonstrations and in war, the Battlebots prefer more expensive and more capable robots. The Battlebots are typically
	built in a neopagan aesthetic with "antlered" heads and simple bodies, while the ancient models have a pair of straight horns coming from
	the sides of a very slightly conical head with complex shoulder adornments.
</p>

<h4 id="tagata">Tagata</h4>
<p>
	A "capitalist utopia" where the rich live lavish lives and any sufficiently driven, and/or skilled, poor can reach the class just below
	the super rich, who buy out everyone else before their wealth is threatened. About 50% of the citizens live in a Kowloon Walled City like
	building known as The Cube, while the rest live in homes ranging from suburbia to private mansions. Rampant consumerism is encouraged in
	Tagata, by both the media and the elite, who are all the more happy to trick the common man into buying them a new yacht.
</p>
<p>
	The city government and military industrial complex of Tagata, including Fana-Suni Heavy Industries, are commonly referred to as the
	Eyebots by the citizens, as that is the name used for their "team" in The Footage. The Eyebots primarily use cheap and fast floating
	robots with limited individual combat capability, the eyebot model being where their name comes from, for The Demonstrations and war.
	Eyebots and their kin are designed to work in larger groups, sometimes with a single, expensive coordinator bot managing whole platoons.
	Early model Eyebots are typically little more than floating spheres with a plasma pistol while ancient models take on bird-like forms,
	though usually with limited articulation to save on production cost.

<h4 id="nuuit">Nuuit</h4>
<p>
	A small settlement roughly a 10 hour drive from <a href="#tagata">Tagata</a> which serves mainly to mine rare earths. The small collection
	of houses in the woods relies heavily on worker robots to pull enough materials out of the mines to meet the quotas set by
	<a href="#tagata">Tagata</a>. As the war between the Battlebots and the Eyebots has raged on, the quotas have become harder and harder to
	fulfil, and Nuuit is now on the verge of being unable to afford maintaining itself.
</p>

<h3 id="galuga">Galuga</h3>
<p>
	Galuga is the northern continent and is made up primarily of large islands that are very sparsely inhabited, with the few residents being
	hermits. The islands themselves see use as automated outposts, dedicated battlefields, or nature preserves. The island of Taua is notable
	for having been the location of choice for the historic triennial battles between Taugofie Robotics and Fana-Suni Heavy Industries, known
	as The Demonstrations, where the two companies deployed large numbers of progressively iterated robots to display to their innovation,
	skill, adaptability and quality to their settlement's militaries, as well as their civilian customers. A television show called The
	Footage compiled all the battle footage and produced 78 episodes (3 years of an episode every other week) of sports-like footage from each
	Demonstrations, with people rooting for their favorite platoon. The Demonstrations have been on hiatus for nearly 2 decades, though reruns
	of The Footage run regularly.
