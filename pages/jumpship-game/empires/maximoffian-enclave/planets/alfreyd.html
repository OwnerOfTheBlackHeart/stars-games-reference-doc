<p>
	The planet of Alfreyd is a slightly cold word with a calm, temperate equator perfect for human life and large arctic ice sheets where most
	of the planet-bound population actually live. This is because the equator is considered a conservation zone by the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-maximoffian-enclave">Maximoffian Enclave</a> and access outside of a limited number of approved resorts is
	heavily restricted. While most of the native life lives in the conservation zone, there is still plentiful biodiversity in the sub-arctic
	and arctic regions where people live. However, a large portion of the population actually live in space in the system in various space
	stations that are able to exploit materials from asteroids that the government does not restrict, or on the moon
	<a href="#orite">Orite</a> where mining colonies and factories provide most of the goods used on Alfreyd.
</p>
<p>
	While the equatorial region of Alfreyd is made up of moderately sized islands, the sub-arctic regions are made up of large island
	continents roughly the size of Australia with smaller surrounding islands. The arctic regions, reaching into what on Earth would have been
	the sub-arctic are made up of ice sheets with occasional sections of permafrosted ground that can grow enough plant life to sustain the
	occasional roaming mammal. The main continents are <a href="#ort">Ort</a>, <a href="#gebiet">Gebiet</a>, and
	<a href="#bauernhof">Bauernhof</a> in the northern hemisphere and <a href="#sudland">Sudland</a>,
	<a href="#nicht-nach-norden">Nicht Nach Norden</a>, <a href="#sechs">Sechs</a>, and <a href="#sieben">Sieben</a> in the southern
	hemisphere.
</p>
<p>
	The people of Alfreyd have a strong relationship with the local wildlife, easily taming and controlling it, choosing to live in harmony
	rather than as masters... until they have a reason to call upon the beasts they love. Many locals choose to live near bonded wild animals
	or keep trained beasts within their homes as pets, with residences more akin to zoos than homes being viewed as uncommon, but not rare.
</p>
<p>
	The <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-fellowship-of-steel">Fellowship of Steel</a> has holdings on the moon Orite and hunts any potentially
	advanced technology in equal parts to take it for themselves as to keep it out of the hands of the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-maximoffian-enclave">Maximoffian Enclave's</a>
	leadership.
</p>

<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>
<h3 id="ort">Ort</h3>
<p>
	The largest continent on Alfreyd, Ort in the northern hemisphere is also the least populated as the continent is primarily marshland, the
	half-frozen mud of which reaches over a mile deep and swallows buildings whole. However, the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-maximoffian-enclave">Maximoffians</a>
	have found a use for Ort: As a hunting ground to practice working with their beasts. The lack of small, disease carrying insects combined
	with varied macro- and megafauna makes the marshes and frozen swamps perfect for this task.
</p>

<h3 id="gebiet">Gebiet</h3>
<p>
	The farthest north continent, Gebiet also happens to hold the highest population of any continent in its arctic clutches. The settlements
	scattered about Gebiet rely on nuclear powerplants to provide sufficient power to heat their cramped, clustered hovels that are optimized
	to keep the heat in without wasting any more power than is absolutely necessary. While most residents consider living in Gebiet to be
	Hell, the government subsidies and cheap housing serve as sufficient encouragement to keep the people here.
</p>

<h3 id="bauernhof">Bauernhof</h3>
<p>
	Sitting in the northern hemisphere, Bauernhof is home to the most arable land of the continents outside of the equatorial nature preserve,
	Bauernhof serves as the breadbasket of Alfreyd. The population is low as the farmers are spread out to minimize the damage that their
	farming causes, leaving transportation in Bauernhof a mixture of ATV paths and dirt roads leading to and from rivers where shallow draft
	vessels carry goods from the ocean inland and goods from inland to the ocean.
</p>

<h3 id="sudland">Sudland</h3>
<p>
	Sudland is what most Alfreydians think of when they imagine the southern hemisphere, with its dense, high quality sub-arctic forests
	providing great quantities of wood to the people of Alfreyd. Due to the value of the old growth trees among the forests of Sudland, the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-maximoffian-enclave">Maximoffians</a> have had to establish especially harsh controls on logging and
	farming in the Sudland. This war against tree poachers and illegal farmers is portrayed similarly to a War on Terror or War on Drugs.
</p>

<h3 id="nicht-nach-norden">Nicht Nach Norden</h3>
<p>
	The southernmost continent island on Alfreyd that isn't covered under the arctic ice, the southern end of Nicht Nach Norden is covered in
	permafrost and is only a short boat ride away from the arctic ice. The continent itself is relatively flat and has many airports that
	service nearby settlements and outposts across the southern ice sheets.
</p>

<h3 id="sechs">Sechs</h3>
<p>
	Made up of six dome mountains formed from hydrovolcanic activity before being carried southward from the northern ice cap, Sechs is the
	closest southern hemisphere continent to the temperate conservation zone. The continent is heavily mined and provides most of the raw
	metals acquired on-planet, with old mines being converted into underground cities complete with factories and apartments. Sechs serves as
	the industrial powerhouse of Alfreyd itself, though its production pales in comparison to <a href="#orite">Orite</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="sieben">Sieben</h3>
<p>
	Made up of seven fold mountains formed from the tectonic plate beneath the southern ice sheet pushing northward, Sieben is a common
	destination for winter sports, thanks to its mixed of steepness among its slopes, its varied terrain, beautiful views, and diverse
	ecosystem. Most settlements are nestled among the slopes of the mountains and provide Alfreyd's highest property values. Home Owners'
	Associations are the banes of residents throughout Sieben, even if tourists never have to deal with them.
</p>

<h3 id="orite">Orite</h3>
<p>
	The only moon of Alfreyd, the surface of Orite is a cratered mess expected of a standard sized moon. However, under the surface are bunker
	cities connected by long freeway tunnels, all of which is kept pressurized. The hundreds of meters of stone and dirt above the bunker
	cities keep them protected from the frequent meteoroid impacts that Orite suffers while also providing convenient access to mining
	opportunities, while the empty mines make way for housing, offices and factories.
</p>
<p>
	Orite is the primary source of manufactured goods and mined minerals used by the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-maximoffian-enclave">Maximoffian Enclave</a>.
