	Williams 6 is a deep space station built from an old factory ship with 2 mobile shipyards from the original Maximoffian Empire fleet. A
	large portion of lisaten have made the Williams home, and many more routinely visit the station for fuel and repairs.

<p>
	The lisaten that call the Williams home have a poor opinion of the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-maximoffian-enclave">Maximoffian Enclave</a> due to the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-maximoffian-enclave">Enclave's</a> restrictive laws, something the naturally chaotic lisaten find deeply
	frustrating.
