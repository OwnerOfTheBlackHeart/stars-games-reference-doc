<p>
	Owned by a <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ql-npcs#joona-niemi">Factor Joona Niemi</a>, who represents the Valkoinen Company and their
	interests on planet, the planet of Fareema technically has its own government, but in reality nothing happens without
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ql-npcs#joona-niemi">Joona's</a>
	blessing. The planet itself is mostly frozen antarctic desert while the equator approaches a livable temperature, at least high enough for
	farming of sturdy, cold resistant crops and animals. The many snowy mountains draw in tourists and vacationers for reliable cold weather
	fun, while the strategic location for use as a trade hub means that goods flow freely to and from Fareema. The could temperatures also
	make cooling industrial sites easy, and so Volkoinen has invested heavily in maximizing the industrial output of the small permanent
	population.
</p>
<p>
	While what TL4 is present on planet is imported, the high density of industry and the focus on relatively cheap TL3 technology means that
	the people have easy access to the products of their industry, and relatively lacking in competition, the Valkoinen Company lacks serious
	incentives to work its employees to the bone. A good employee that lives a long, healthy, and productive life means profit from both their
	productivity and their consumption.

<h3 id="kylma">Kylma</h3>
<p>
	Located on the equator and at the center of a circle of volcanoes, Kylma is the largest stretch of arable land on Fareema and where most
	of the population lives. It also happens to be home to many resorts that offer everything from skiing to snowmobiling adventures and
	nature walks.
</p>
<p>
	The population is broken up into several city-states that compete for tourism amongst themselves as well as for investments from
	Volkoinen.
</p>

<h4 id="flunssa">Flunssa</h4>
<p>
	Flunssa is the largest city-state on <a href="#kylma">Kylma</a> and contains the public spaceport as well as the central hub for the local
	train network. The local headquarters of the Valkoinen Company also makes the city its home. While Flunssa actually has the lowest tourist
	appeal due to the large volume of industry built in and around the city, the local hot springs and race track help locals and new arrivals
	relax.
