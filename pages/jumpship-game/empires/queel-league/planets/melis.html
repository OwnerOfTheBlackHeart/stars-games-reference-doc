<p>
	The homeworld of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ihmiset">ihmisets</a> and capital of the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-queel-league">Queel League</a>, Melis is a nearly Earth-like world with a biochemistry just different
	enough to be toxic to human life. The <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ihmiset">ihmisets</a> inhabiting the planet have spread to nearly
	every corner of the available landmass and have grown used to the power and influence they are able to exert over their colonies, leading
	to a somewhat decadent culture with a love of exploring new places and feelings with a "burned out" morality. The
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ihmiset">ihmisets</a> themselves live in tightly packed cities with a mix of farms, industrial sites, and
	nature parks taking up the lands not actively used for residential space.
</p>
<p>
	The people of Melis live lives of comparative luxury with inter-tribe politics taking up the majority of their lives as they seek to
	explore as much as they can while fulfilling all their personal responsibilities. Most don't consider the effects their life styles have
	on the colonies, and only see the colonies as an expensive, hostile local to one day explore.
</p>

<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>
<h3 id="onkia">Onkia</h3>
<p>
	A warm continent located near the equator, Onkia is a land of inland seas, countless lakes, and innumerable rivers with forests and
	jungles nearly end to end. Considered the optimal climate by the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ihmiset">ihmisets</a>, Onkia is heavily
	populated and serves as an industrial giant on the industrial giant that is the planet Melis. Swimming and sunbathing are common
	recreational activities while fishing, both wild and farmed, makes up a significant portion of both the diet and economy of the locals.
</p>

<h4 id="kalastaja">Kalastaja</h4>
<p>
	Home of the largest spaceport in <a href="#onkia">Onkia</a>, and the whole of Melis, Kalastaja also happens to be home to the Society of
	Guardian Explorers, a coalition of private citizens, aerospace manufacturers, pilots, and explorers dedicated to discovering safe warp
	lanes throughout the sector. Kalastaja is a tight, cramped city made up of concrete buildings housing thousands of
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ihmiset">ihmisets</a> each. Despite the generally unplanned nature of Kalastaja's expansion, the public
	transportation network of the city is outstandingly well designed and highly resilient to even severe disruptions.
</p>

<h4 id="puu">Puu</h4>
<p>
	Puu is the home of the Valkoinen Company Corporate Headquarters and is where most of the ion engines used in the starships of the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-queel-league">Queel League</a> are produced. The city has a mostly flat surface with large cargo spaceports
	and an orbital lifters connection to a cargo station in geostationary orbit above the city, with the population living underground in the
	supporting structures of the surface installations. Public transportation within Puu is unreliable at best, however the city connects to
	all the large freeways of <a href="#onkia">Onkia</a>, providing easy access to the city and the space elevator.
</p>

<h4 id="laake">Laake</h4>
<p>
	Laake is the home of the Musta Pharmaceuticals Company, who own roughly 30% of the city, particularly the surrounds and the rainforest
	farmlands where they grow the many crops needed to produce the base compounds for the many drugs and health care products they produce.
	One of the less packed cities on <a href="onkia">Onkia</a> with plenty of greenery to break up the concrete jungle, Laake is one of the
	most expensive places on Melis to live. Public transportation within Laake is... distinctly acceptable.
