<p>
	The planet of Maz is a cold world with highly fought over pockets of warmth and their associated oxygen vents, with its 70% chemical
	weapon by volume atmosphere. TL4 habitats are the only survivable locations on the planet, which are fought over by the dwindling
	population in brutal trench warfare even as the swarms of passing comets and meteors frequently dump potentially lethal objects down upon
	the denizens of Maz. In order to acquire the advanced technology they require to survive, many warriors of Maz head out into the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-queel-league">Queel League</a> as mercenaries.
</p>
<p>
	The people of Maz live hard lives between the low population, the constant fighting over the few resources required just to breathe, the
	failed industrial sector, the star system seeming to hate them, and the remains of the weapons that brought them to their current point.
</p>

<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>
<h3 id="kuolema">Koulema</h3>
<p>
	Koulema is a small region of the planet of Maz clustered around a field of technically heated gas vents that force out warm atmospheric
	gas similar in composition to the planet's original atmosphere with a high oxygen content. The heating of the land makes the area usable
	for agriculture with significant work while the vents provide vital gasses for breathing, and as such the area is heavily contested by the
	natives. Trenches and destroyed machines span as far as the eye can see.
</p>

<h4 id="yksi">Yksi</h4>
<p>
	Built around one of the two functioning sealed spaceports, Yksi is the closest thing Maz has to a city, though it is closer to a small
	town. The inside of the city is held together by spit and duct tape as the local people try to maintain their home with the rare imports
	and TL2 technology while simultaneously waging a war of conquest of the oxygen fields, the output of which they use to force others to
	trade food and neutralizing paste to keep their society alive.
</p>

<h4 id="kaksi">Kaksi</h4>
<p>
	Built around the second of the two functioning sealed spaceports, Kaksi is a large village under the rule of whatever random warlord
	manages to make the most appealing promise to the villages military. The <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ihmiset">ihmisets</a> that call
	Kaksi home are treated almost like cattle, those not drafted into the military forced to undertake the dangerous process of mass producing
	neutralizing paste while only the habitat itself sees repairs from leadership, leaving the civilians to build their homes out of whatever
	scrap material they can manage to scavenge.
