	The Wernume Imperium, ruled from the Royal Palace on <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-joantopha">Joantopha</a>, is currently subservient to
	Emperor Hanalei Kalua's will. All planets within the Imperium serve the Emperor without question, as to do so is the easiest way to
	maintain their present honor. In turn, the Emperor ensures that all the planets within his realm are protected and well managed, at least
	well enough that his obligations are fulfilled.

<p>
	The Wernume Imperium's isolation means that the only neighbors that the Imperium needs to concern itself with are the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-queel-league">Queel League</a>, who are a small, non-hostile, and young neighbor, which the Imperium treats
	like a younger sibling. The <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ihmiset">ihmisets'</a> love of learning about new locations and history giving
	the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-kanaka">kanaka</a> a chance to brag about themselves and their accomplishments certainly doesn't hurt
	the relationship.
