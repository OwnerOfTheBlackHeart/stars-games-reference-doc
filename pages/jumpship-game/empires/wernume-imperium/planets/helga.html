<p>
	Helga is a cold world with an slightly-orange atmosphere that gives the world a constant foggy appearance and serves as the first
	successful colony of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-wernume-imperium">Wernume Imperium</a>. The large population has resulted in Helga
	having three super houses: Akela (which is the current ruling house), Noe, and Pula. The three houses keep each other in check, with
	particularly difficult conflicts dealt with by tournament or duel rather than all out warfare. Meanwhile, the locals have taken on two
	particular habits that have disturbed outsiders: Heavy genetic modification to survive in the thick atmosphere naturally and the use of
	the dead as a supplement for their population reaching the world's limit for agriculture.
</p>
<p>
	Helga is broken up into clusters of rocky soil connected by massive ice sheets with no discernable continents. A short orbital period and
	matching rotation create a slowly moving light and dark side of the planet, creating seasons that last Terra Standard Years each that
	range from hot spring to mid-winter temperatures and extreme weather.
</p>
<p>
	The planetary administration, and distribution of territory, is done by noble house and super house, with the noble house serving a role
	similar to a barony and the super house serving a role more akin to a duchy while King Holokai Akela rules the planet itself.
</p>

<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>
<h3 id="akela">Akela</h3>
<p>
	Ruled by "Duke" Anatoni Akela, Akela is the holdings of the super house Akela and is the smallest in terms of landmass; However, the
	Akelas hold the largest number of spacecraft, and as a result, the most manufacturing capacity. They are currently in the equivalent of
	fall and are rushing to get enough indoor farming facilities running to sustain them through the coming long winter.
</p>

<h4 id="pa-kaua">Pa'Kaua</h4>
<p>
	Pa'Kaua, the current royal city, rests in a land preparing for winter. Beautiful gardens still remain, but are slowly being stocked with
	hardy plants that can remain beautiful during the transition to winter. The majority of the city is dedicated to administration and
	computer technologies rather than manufacturing, leaving the air clean.
</p>
<p>
	Pa'Kaua has a private spaceport that belongs to the royal family that is only available for use with permission. The royal family,
	particularly Queen Elena, are normally willing to allow the use of two of the landing pads to private or commercial traffic if a
	sufficient reason for landing in Pa'Kaua is given (and one of the landing pads is open).
</p>

<h4 id="kaa">Ka'a</h4>
<p>
	Ka'a is <a href="#akela">Akela's</a> capital and primary transportation hub. The city sprawls out from the large spaceport, which includes
	an orbital elevator. Freeways, airports and railways spread out from the city in a spoke wheel pattern with factories located on the
	outside of the wheel.
</p>

<h3 id="noe">Noe</h3>
<p>
	Ruled by "Duchess" Hoku Noe, Noe is the holdings of the super house Noe. Due to recent concessions from <a href="#pula">Pula</a> running
	out of food stores, Noe has become the physically largest of the super houses. The Noe family has invested heavily in food production from
	the original founding of Helga and manages to be a major exporter of food even during the winter, though being in the hottest season has
	given Noe an absolute windfall of agriculture.
</p>

<h4 id="mea-ai">Mea'ai</h4>
<p>
	Mea'ai is <a href="#noe">Noe's</a> capital and home to the sole spaceport in <a href="#noe">Noe</a>, as well as a direct high speed cargo
	train line to <a href="kaa">Ka'a</a>. The city is surrounded by growing factories and hydroponics facilities, and large tracts of farmland
	that are taking full advantage of the prime growing season. Thanks to the cheap food the farms are producing, the restaurant scene in
	Mea'ai is exploding.
</p>

<h3 id="pula">Pula</h3>
<p>
	Ruled by "Duchess" Kelia Pula, Pula is the holdings of the super house Pula. The middle child in terms of holdings, the Pula family has
	kept the super house relevant through sheer reproduction. Residents of Pula are free and open about sex, and quick to use the many casinos
	and arenas to entertain themselves, which brings in tourists and provides Pula a massive advantage in the flesh trade, both dead and
	alive.
</p>

<h4 id="ano">Ano</h4>
<p>
	Ano is <a href="#pula">Pula's</a> capital and Helga's equivalent to Las Vegas. Currently well within the winter season, casinos and
	whorehouses dominate the entertainment market, though winter sports events and similar luxuries draw in plenty of tourists as well. The
	spaceport is connected to the airport, roughly a 30 minute drive from the city proper.
