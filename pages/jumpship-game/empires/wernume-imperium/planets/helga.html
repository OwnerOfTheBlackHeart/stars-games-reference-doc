<p>
	Helga is the homeworld of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ijudi">ijudis</a>, despite being somewhat primitive by comparison to the
	colonies of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ijudi">ijudis</a>. Thanks to the manipulations of a few individuals, Helga's initial space
	travel technology was scurried off with once more advanced species made contact with the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ijudi">ijudis</a>,
	leaving the homeworld deprived of the advanced technology. And thanks to the reputation the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ijudi">ijudis</a>, Helga has been denied a second chance and made to try and catch up with its own
	colonies, often unsuccessfully.
</p>
<p>
	The planet itself is a comfortable world for life, with excessive amounts of water and swampy terrain spread among the four continents:
	<a href="#mokri">Mokri</a>, <a href="#drvo">Drvo</a>, Neuspeh, and Nada. <a href="#mokri">Mokri</a>, located on the equator, is the
	hottest and wettest continent on Helga and the natural territory of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ijudi">ijudis'</a> ancestors, and
	also the most populated continent. <a href="#drvo">Drvo</a> is located from the equator to the south pole of the planet and was once both
	the most populated continent and most heavily industrialize, however local wars have dropped the population heavily and devastated the
	infrastructure. <a href="#neuspeh">Neuspeh</a> is the furthest north and the coldest of the continents, which also has the highest
	percentage of saltwater swamps, has gone from hostile waste to vitally important to Helga as the region is rich with rare earth metals,
	valuable commodities when trying to advance space travel. <a href="#nada">Nada</a> is opposite of <a href="#mokri">Mokri</a> on the
	equator and is the driest of the continents, which makes the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ijudi">ijudis</a> uninterested in developing
	the inland regions of <a href="#nada">Nada</a>. MEGAcorp, however, has realized that inland Nada is quite comfortable for human life and
	have setup an outpost for supporting their trading expeditions into <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-queel-league">Queel League</a> space,
	which is little more than a few spaceports and warehouses hidden where the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ijudi">ijudis</a> won't do
	anything to stop them.
</p>

<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>
<h3 id="mokri">Mokri</h3>
<p>
	Mokri, located on the equator, is the hottest and wettest continent on Helga and the natural territory of the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ijudi">ijudis'</a> ancestors, and also the most populated continent. The local tribes place low value on
	the individual and are ready to sacrifice lives to get whatever they want; However, the chieftains themselves are much more cautious,
	seeing what has happened to <a href="drvo">Drvo</a> and wishing to protect their tribes' hard to replace holdings from intertribal strife.
</p>

<h4 id="zona">Zona</h4>
<p>
	The "capital" of <a href="#mokri">Mokri</a>, Zona is placed almost dead on the equator, leading to it being extremely hot and humid for a
	temperate world. Little industrial activity actually happens in Zona, with bullet trains carrying locals out of the packed apartments in
	the center of the city out to the surrounding cities to work at various factories and office buildings in less residential areas. The
	strong train connections make Zona the clear choice for where to place the primary spaceport of <a href="#mokri">Mokri</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="drvo">Drvo</h3>
<p>
	Drvo is located from the equator to the south pole of the planet and was once both the most populated continent and most heavily
	industrialize, however local wars have dropped the population heavily and devastated the infrastructure. The tribes of Drvo have been
	working to rebuild, but see frequent interference from unknown forces that they believe to be agents of
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ijudi">ijudis</a> who benefit from them not having access to jumpships.
</p>

<h4 id="mit">Mit</h4>
<p>
	The clear winner of the last major conflict on <a href="#drvo">Drvo</a>, Mit City was able to rebuild its spaceport... and made all the
	losers pay for it. The city is a mix of seemingly ancient buildings and very recent constructions, though the actual factories are still
	damaged in ways that are far harder to fix and the population is lower than the local tribe cares to admit.
</p>

<h3 id="neuspeh">Neuspeh</h3>
<p>
	Neuspeh is the furthest north and the coldest of the continents, which also has the highest percentage of saltwater swamps, has gone from
	hostile waste to vitally important to Helga as the region is rich with rare earth metals, valuable commodities when trying to advance
	space travel. The tribes that control this region are brutal in how they deal with others, happily descending into violence wielding shock
	clubs and knives so as to avoid damaging anything they actually value. Industrial theft is a constant back and forth in Neuspeh.
</p>

<h4 id="mneto">Mneto</h4>
<p>
	Using an old strip mine and a few abandoned pit mines as the basis of the spaceport, Mneto is merely the biggest of the options of where
	to land on <a href="neuspeh">Neuspeh</a> and is also technically the safest. Though safest does not mean safe, as the mining conglomerates
	that command the local tribes are quick to violence when they sense any threat to them or their operations.
</p>

<h3 id="nada">Nada</h3>
<p>
	Nada is opposite of <a href="#mokri">Mokri</a> on the equator and is the driest of the continents, which makes the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ijudi">ijudis</a> uninterested in developing the inland regions of Nada. While the costal swamps claim a
	relatively high population density of <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-ijudi">ijudis</a>, the inland regions are avoided and considered too
	inhospitable for permanent habitation. Instead, MEGAcorp has figured out that they can setup an outpost near the center of the continent
	and use their fast transports to avoid defensive spacecraft in order to have a safe, tax-free haven to serve as a staging ground for
	operations in the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-queel-league">Queel League</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="heavens-pass">Heaven's Pass</h4>
<p>
	Heaven's Pass is a MEGAcorp outpost operated jointly by STARcorp, SPACEcorp, and TRAVELcorp that serves as a resupply and maintenance stop
	for spacecraft making the journey to the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-queel-league">Queel League</a> and as a vacation resort. Heaven's
	Pass is made up of a spaceport, an apartment building where the permanent and semi-permanent residents live, a large hydroponics lab, a
	fancy yet cheap hotel, a suite of amusement rides, and a large surrounding forest treated as a nature park.
