<h2 id="appearance-and-biology">Appearance and Biology</h2>
<p>
	The ludzie are a race of bat-like humanoids with severe sexual diamorphism. Both sexes possess tall and wide ears, and wings that extend
	from their shoulders, down to somewhere between the hips and the knees, and typically have either black or brown fur/hair, though gray
	does occasionally pop up. An individual wing is typically 1.5 to 3 times as wide as the ludzie is tall, giving a wingspan 3 to 6 times
	their height, and contains a hand on the second “joint” with which a ludzie can manipulate its environment. Both sexes also have feet with
	long, grasping appendages tipped with sharp claws that can be used to grab onto, and hang from, objects such as cave ceilings, thick tree
	branches and artificial roosting struts. All ludzie are capable of echolocation. While rarely seen, ludzie skin is a light blue-gray or
	light red-gray.
</p>
<p>
	Male ludzie stand between 1.8 to 2.4 meters (6 to 8 feet) tall, possess a muzzle filled with short, sharp teeth with 4 longer “grasping”
	fangs, and a body covered in fur (the exact length varies based on lineage). Male ludzie eyes are typically entirely black or entirely
	red, giving them excellent night vision and thermal vision.
</p>
<p>
	Female ludzie stand between 0.9 to 1.5 meters (3 to 5 feet) tall with a human-like face, a maw filled with fruit bat-like teeth, and
	generally human-like torsos and legs. Females typically have fur covering their bodies, though some have exposed skin, which is shorter
	than males of the same lineage. Female ludzie eyes are human-like, though far more developed for long range, high contrast vision. Females
	are notably more agile in flight when compared to males.
</p>
<p>
	The two sexes of ludzie have different times that they are awake and different diets. While omnivorous, male ludzie prefer a higher
	protein diet and to operate during the night (when they can attack sleeping prey) while female ludzie prefer a diet primarily of fruit,
	with occasional vegetables and meat mixed in, and to operate during the day (when they can easily spot fruits while flying about). The two
	sexes are both awake during dawn and dusk, which is when most of the socializing happens
</p>
<p>
	The ludzie wear clothes that connect at the shoulders and crotch, typically fitting the torso tightly. When out hunting or traveling long
	distances, ludzie wear sky blue, forest green, bark brown, or colors that match their fur. When about their homes and cities, the ludzie
	wear vibrant and striking clothes, with bright purples and oranges being among the most popular. The most common forms of ludzie jewelry
	are the ankle bracelet and the earring, both of which are made of wood, bone, leather or other lightweight materials, with embedded jewels
	and colorful metals added as thin films.
</p>

<h2 id="government-structure-and-society">Government, Structure, and Society</h2>
<p>Oligarchic</p>
<p>
	The ludzie of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="jump-dechtum-ardurix">Dechtum Ardurix</a> have abandoned their normally complex government
	when they settled within Cornu Curta, instead having the shapers use the sudden desperation of learning the rules of a new sector and
	needing everything made anew to take control of society. Now guilds of shapers serve as the true political power of the ludzie, with any
	governments built around them little more than extensions of the guilds' wills.
</p>
<p>
	Despite their abandonment of their previously complex government structure, the ludzie still follow Syzygism and venerate art in their
	works. Within the guilds, masters of their crafts hold the most power regardless of seniority and have the capacity to make or break any
	given project, though conflicts within a guild rarely devolve to that level of petty conflict.
</p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p>
	The technology of the ludzie has two distinctive attributes: Its lightweight and the fact that the vast majority of it is biological
	technology. To power their biotechnology, the ludzie use small cells containing high density algae that act like A or B cells (depending
	on their size) and only require direct sunlight, or a high energy UV lamp, to recharge (though the bio-cells require special minerals to
	be added every 100, or so, full recharges). Due to their heavy use of biotechnology, most constructions of the ludzie are made of stone,
	“bone,” and wood, though metal is still occasionally used.
</p>
<p>
	If no bio-cells are available, A-cell ludzie technology can be powered by a day’s ration or by feeding the device directly from the user,
	costing 1 system strain. B-cell ludzie technology can be powered by an impromptu “bio-cell” made from 10 spaceship supplies.
</p>
<p>
	Due to their natural flight ability, ludzie have only developed ground and water vehicles for the purpose of transporting large amounts of
	goods, with flying vehicles being seen as what you fly when you need to go further than you’d be able to fly normally.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Ludzie weapons, armor, and equipment that is in a less than perfect recovers 1 condition rating per day as long as it is fed, as per the
		rules of the individual piece of equipment.
	</li>
	<li>
		Armor
		<ul>
			<li>
				Due to the limitations of natural flight, ludzie armors are designed to be as light as they can be while providing adequate
				protection, reducing the enc by 1, to a minimum of 0. Armor that has been damaged, such as by having its prior wielder be killed,
				can be fed 1 days ration per every 100 credits of cost to allow it to heal over the course of 1 week. Armor damaged by gunnery
				weapons, or similar tools of total destruction, dies.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Weapons
		<ul>
			<li>Due to the distances that occur during fight, weapons designed by the ludzie have 1.5x their normal range</li>
			<li>
				Weapons made by the ludzie are reloaded using either bio-cells (as described above) if energy weapons or by a day’s ration if a
				projectile weapon.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Mechs
		<ul>
			<li>
				For the sake of vehicle/mech biomass: specialized ludzie feed mass, 5,000 credits of vehicle/mech biomass can be fit per ton, while
				general feedstock biomass can only hold 500 credits per ton. 1 ship supply is equivalent to 10 credits of vehicle/mech biomass. If
				in environments with sufficient biomass, a mech can graze up to 200 credits worth of biomass per hour, but this counts towards
				maintenance time.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mechs produced by the ludzie require maintenance as normal, but it is in vehicle/mech biomass equal in cost to normal maintenance.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mechs produced by the ludzie heal on their own, at a rate of 1 hit point per day for lights, 2 hit points per day for mediums and 4
				hit points per day for heavies. Healing still requires the normal amount cost in vehicle/mech biomass (500 credits per hit point for
				suits or 1,000 credits per hit point for light and heavy mechs).
				<ul>
					<li>
						Ludzie mechs are affected by biopsionics, but due to their far greater biomass, it is less effective than healing a person or
						animal. Light mechs heal 1 hit point per 3 hit points normally healed, rounding up, and have 6 system strain. Medium mechs heal
						1 hit point per 6 hit points normally healed, rounding up, and have 12 system strain. Heavy mechs heal 1 hit point per 6 hit
						points normally healed, rounding up, and have 18 system strain.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Even when not in use, ludzie mechs require their maintenance be paid at least once per month.</li>
			<li>
				“Intelligent” ludzie mechs can be acquired that have intelligence equal to an expert system with a +1 skill and +3 to attack rolls
				when operating without a pilot. “Intelligent” ludzie mech hulls cost 1.5x as much as normal and require double the maintenance costs
				to maintain the metabolic strain of the expert system.
			</li>
			<li>The Antigrav Nodes fitting only costs 2# power and 3# mass for ludzie mechs. The credit cost is unaffected.</li>
			<li>The Void Thrusters fitting only costs 1# power and 1.5# mass, rounding down. The credit cost is unaffected.</li>
