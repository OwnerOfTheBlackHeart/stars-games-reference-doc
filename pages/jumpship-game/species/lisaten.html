<h1>Lisaten</h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>Species Name:</b> Lisaten</li>
	<li><b>Plural:</b> Lisaten</li>
	<li><b>Naming Language:</b> Russian</li>
	<li><b>Body Type:</b> Mammalian</li>

<h2 id="appearance-and-biology">Appearance and Biology</h2>
<p>
	The Lisaten evolved as a race of egg eaters that disguise themselves as the young of egg laying creatures to get close to and steal the
	eggs of said creatures. They are normally shy, but those that are outgoing tend to be extremely outgoing. Natural form is that of a
	roughly human sized fox with feather like fur, 2 long and hairless tails, and 4 eyes (two depth perception and two for wide angle vision).
</p>

<h2 id="government-structure-and-society">Government, Structure, and Society</h2>
<p>
	The Lisaten learned spaceflight, human pronounceable names, and how to make alcohol from Markin crashing into their planet. They revere
	various depictions of drunken, snarky pilots as the Star God, whose exact race is up for heavy debate. Those who believe that the Star God
	is human often try to lead ships, armies, and/or navies of "lesser" humans to gain the favor of the Star God and his kin.
</p>
<p>
	Most wouldn't consider the Lisaten to have an actual government, as due to their natural shyness they avoid gathering in large groups.
	Instead, lisaten travel in nomadic troops or settle in enclaves on other species's worlds, only showing their true forms in private.

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p>
	Lisaten normally use whatever technology the people they are presently imitating use, however those lisaten that manage to gain access to
	manufacturing capability create technology with a focus around stealth and endurance. While lisaten infantry gear is prized by special
	forces, it is their ships that are best well known, which are sought after by explorers and merchants for their endurance and ability to
	operate far from civilization.
