<h2 id="appearance-and-biology">Appearance and Biology</h2>
<p>
	The abantu are beetle-like humanoids standing roughly 3 meters (10 feet) tall with sturdy, thick chitinous shells, short mandibles that
	hug tightly to the mouth, short stiff antenna, large, complex eyes, and four arms. Abantu shells are colorful and metallic, the exact
	color determined by the diet of the abantu, with many abantu eating various ores or pearls to develop their preferred shell colors. Abantu
	hands possess three fingers and a thumb. The abantu lack any means to fly and have a solid back plate.
</p>
<p>The abantu are herbivorous with a preference for woody plants and bark, though they will scavenge fresh kills given the chance.</p>

<h2 id="government-structure-and-society">Government, Structure, and Society</h2>
<p>
	The abantu like to keep their government efficient and transparent, usually having government officials voted in to act as representatives
	present proposals to the collective people the proposal will effect, usually the county or state the proposal affects, who then vote on
	whether to accept or deny the proposal. At the planetary or imperial level, positions are elected and don't have to go through getting
	votes from the whole of the affected populace, however any decision they make can be overturned by collective vote and if they preform
	poorly, they may not see their next term in office.
</p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p>
	The abantu favor innovative and advanced technologies over simple and tested technologies, and prefer to protect themselves with armor as
	thick and heavy as their own shells.
