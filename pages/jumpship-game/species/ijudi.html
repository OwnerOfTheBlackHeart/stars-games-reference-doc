<h2 id="appearance-and-biology">Appearance and Biology</h2>
<p>
	The ijudi are feathered amphibious humanoids that typically stand around 2.2 meters (7' 3") tall. The ijudi have slimy, feathered skin
	that is capable of changing colors from dull browns and greens to bright blues, yellows and purples, large, frog-like heads with poison
	glands on the sides of their neck and large, strong arms that unfold into either small fins or large wings, while ijudi feet are heavily
	webbed. Ijudi flight is clumsy and well optimized for gliding, long distance travel. In the water, however, ijudi are fast, nimble
	predators that use a mix of ambush and rush-down hunting strategies.
</p>
<p>
	The ijudi's natural diet consists of roughly any animal cat-sized or smaller that an ijudi can fit into their mouth in a single bite.
	Ijudi are immune to any poison in the food they eat as their bodies sequester it in their poison glands. This immunity does not protect
	them from poisons that are absorbed through a means other than their digestive tract.
</p>
<p>The ijudi posses almost no sexual dimorphism.</p>

<h2 id="government-structure-and-society">Government, Structure, and Society</h2>
<p>
	The ijudi organize themselves into tribes that control roughly state sized tracts of land that are lead by a chieftain, who then has
	family elders that rule smaller tracts of land below them and keep the chieftain appraised of the goings on in their territory. Acquiring
	chieftainhood is normally about convincing your tribe that you have enough support to challenge the chieftain and then convincing said
	chieftain to stepdown peacefully, either through false influence or through deniable actions.
</p>
<p>
	Planetary decisions are made at monthly moots where all the chieftains meet and decide on what policies they will all follow, typically to
	ensure that they have protections against foreign powers and to ensure that internal threats don't spread between tribes. While the moots
	technically have the authority to enforce policies that are focused inward, the personal interests of individual chieftains and tribes
	make it so these types of policies almost never make it through a moot. Federal/imperial level decisions are made at a twice annual moot
	of the chieftains decided by the moots to represent their planet. Similar to planetary moots, imperial moots rarely make much headway on
	policies other than collective defense.
</p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p>
	Due to the ijudi's ability to traverse land, air, and fresh water naturally, their technology is designed to operate in any environment,
	while their traditionalism leads them to prefer proven technologies over unproven, but innovative ones.
