<h2 id="appearance-and-biology">Appearance and Biology</h2>
<p>
	The ihmiset are a fur-covered, humanoid species that average 0.5 meters (1' 6") in height with dragon-like eyes, a mouth full of sharp
	teeth, a single, large talon on each of their hands and feet, blunt digging claws, and a tail nearly as long as they are. Female ihmiset
	have bone plates and spikes along their backs, dull colored fur that helps them blend in, and stand around 0.2 meters (6 inches) taller
	than males. Meanwhile, males have dark, rich furs typically of green, red, or blue color, colorful frills along their back, and a crown of
	horns designed to lock into the horns of other males.
</p>
<p>
	Despite their appearance suggesting obligate predation, ihmiset are actually omnivores. Their natural diet is a mix of leathery skinned
	fruits, large insects, small lizards and mammals, and megafauna that tribes of ihmiset attack in large groups that use their sharp teeth
	to rip open the skin of the beasts to cause blood loss over long hunts.
</p>
<p>
	Ihmiset have the ability to spray a sticky, smelly irritant as means of self defense. While one ihmiset's ejection is unpleasant, the
	ihmiset prefer to spray threats in groups, creating overwhelming itchiness and pain and a smell that would make a skunk turn their nose
	up.

<p>It is common for ihmiset to get the assisted glide system cyberware.</p>

<h2 id="government-structure-and-society">Government, Structure, and Society</h2>
<p>
	The ihmiset organize themselves into tribes of 100 to 300 hundred members based on family that travel together in subgroups of 5 to 20
	ihmisets. For proper governance, provinces elect their leaders for both the province and planetary positions. Federal/imperial positions,
	on the other hand, are elected only by chieftains or elders appointed by a chieftain for the purpose of the vote. All elected positions
	have to cater to the chieftains as most individuals in any given tribe will vote for the same officials as their chieftain.
</p>
<p>
	Due to the ihmisets' love of exploring, those ihmisets that are not present for a vote either leave their choices with a relative to vote
	for them or accept that their vote will automatically match that of their chieftain.
