<h2 id="appearance-and-biology">Appearance and Biology</h2>
<p>
	The kanaka are a race of pterodactyl-like humanoids with two arms, two wings and two legs. The average kanaka stands at roughly 2 meters
	(6 1/2 feet) with a pair of piercing, forward facing eyes, a short, hooked beak, and a smooth head, though males also possess a frill on
	the back of their head. The flesh of the kanaka ranges from brown to green and has a stiff, smooth texture. Both the hands and feet of the
	kanaka possess retractable claws that allow them to climb trees and stone with ease, mainly to gain altitude to jump from.
</p>
<p>
	Kanaka can fly, though adults struggle to get lift from a standing position. Depending on the race of the individual, they may prefer to
	climb high and jump to start flight or to sprint across the ground and use the speed to provide them the initial lift.
</p>
<p>Female kanaka tend to be roughly the same height as males, but more muscular and stouter of build.</p>

<h2 id="government-structure-and-society">Government, Structure, and Society</h2>
<p>
	The Kanaka have a relatively simple structure: The King of Kings (or Queen of Kings) stands at the top of the pecking order, ruling over
	all kanaka. The kings and queens are in charge of ruling individual planets how they see fit.
</p>
<p>
	Individual kings and queens form their governments as much to suit their individual preferences as to cater to the local leaders, ensuring
	that those important to maintaining their power are kept happy and unambitious. Most kings and queens work hard to ensure that any
	underlings who prove to be too capable and ambitious are removed of before they can become a threat to their position and the honor of
	holding it.
</p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p>
	The kanaka favor personal honor over staking the deck in their favor and make effective tools that serve their purpose with few extra
	features. Their powered armor, plasma weapons, and melee weapons, viewed as signs of honor and status, are crafted with the utmost care,
	while ranged weapons and standard armor are made for "lesser" individuals, A.K.A. cheaply.
