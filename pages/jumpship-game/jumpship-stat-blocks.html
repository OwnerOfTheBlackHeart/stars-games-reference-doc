			A seemingly simple warbot with an ostentatious feathered headdress, the basic battlebot offers a surprising amount of killing
			potential for a package its size. While typically deployed in small groups, the advanced targeting system within the basic battlebot
			is capable of engaging two targets with surprising accuracy, especially when the basic battlebot begins dumping internal power
			reserves to power burst shots from both cutter rifles.

			Adorned with a head like that of an antlered deer but with1 little else to make it appear special, the battlebot commander serves as
			the command unit for
			<a href="#basic-battlebot">basic battlebots</a>, with the powerful antennas in its horns allowing it to serve as a comm set from
			Starvation Cheap. Battlebot Commanders are capable of fighting while simultaneously processing surprising amounts of on field tactical
			data and making decisions about easy targets and weak points in enemy defenses, commanding its lessers to focus their fire to
			tactically advantageous locations. The grenade launcher of a battlebot commander carries 6 grenades, typically air-burst frag, tear
			gas or a mix of the two.

			Adorned with a fake beard and painted on scars, this battlebot resembles a humanoid form wearing only pants with a large hump on its
			right side. That large hump carries an integrated heavy cutter powered by an internal juicebox, removing the heavy weapon's load from
			the limited battery of the battlebot. Battlebot heavies serve as the main anti-vehicle punch of a battlebot war squad, though they are
			far from above deploying the heavy cutter in suppressive mode or to rip a whole open in enemy fortifications.
		</p>
		<p>
			Battlebot heavies adorn themselves in anti-vehicle weapons, carrying 4 TL4 single shot rocket launchers, 6 demo charges and a
			specially designed juicebox for recharging allied battlebots when they are running low on power. Battlebot heavies occasionally hand
			their portable gunnery weapons over to allied battlebots, usually when it would be tactically valuable to be able to launch more than
			1 rocket in a turn.

			Sporting a pair of sturdy horns on its head, which house sensors and communication systems, a body the size of a smart car, and what
			appears to be a furred mantle, this humanoid warbot is pushing the edge of what TL4 technology can achieve. Armed with a pair of
			overcharged cutter rifles, which roll their damage twice and take the higher damage, and a heavy laser that has been re-engineered to
			use a focused magnetic beam to clear the metallic fog before firing, the battlebot jarl is a highly desired piece of ancient Battlebot
			engineering. Those who manage to get their hands on a battlebot jarl quickly learn the hard way that these machines are incredibly
			hard to control, with surviving models typically being VIs hyper-fixated on destroying their enemies without regard to their own
			safety or the orders of their owners. When a standard expert system model of the battlebot jarl is found, its mere presence and
			obedience can rapidly change the local balance of power.

		<p>
			Battlebot jarls are powered by integrated microfusion generators that, while unable to explode in nuclear fire due to the presence of
			nuke snuffers preventing that self destruct sequence, are capable of being turned into deadly area weapons. Upon deciding to self
			destruct, a battlebot jarl overloads its fusion generator, causing a nuclear fusion reaction just below the typical interruption point
			of nuke snuffers, and then breaches reactor containment. The resultant beam of heat and ionizing radiation affects a 45 degree, 250
			meter long cone originating from the jarl and forces all creatures in the blast to make an immediate reaction saving throw. Failing
			the throw means instant death while succeeding means that the creature loses half of their current hit points. Organic creatures take
			a lethal dose of radiation regardless of if they succeeded their saving throw, and will need to seek a TL4 hospital for treatment
			within the month if they wish to survive. This self destruct sequence inevitably leaves the battlebot jarl as little more than a pile
			of fused metals coated in short term radioactive fallout.

			Using as many of the same components as the <a href="#basic-eyebot">basic eyebot</a> as possible, eyebot heavies provide Eyebot squads
			with the ability to engage vehicles, though they only carry 4 shots in their rocket launchers. Eyebot heavies tend to avoid infantry
			unless they are loaded with frag missiles.

			An ancient model of Eyebot which takes the form of a hawk where only the head and the legs move, designed to fly high and fast,
			selecting targets and swooping down to strike with the integrated plasma pistol or claws before ascending back beyond sight within the
			fog. While frail, Hawk Eyebots gain +4 to hit and +2 to damage when making a diving attack, though they must make the attack from at
			least 75 meters in altitude above the target. Hawk Eyebots can attack mid-movement without penalty.
