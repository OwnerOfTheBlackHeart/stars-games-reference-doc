<h1>Kodia, Goddess of Abundance</h1>
<p>
	The most recently risen of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="the-three-above">Three Above</a>, Kodia claimed domain over abundance after she
	used her considerable elementalist powers to end a 5 year drought in the land known as Enmorach. Kodia is portrayed as a motherly, caring
	figure. Visual depictions of Kodia feature blues and greens, with the goddess herself being portrayed as a woman younger and more
	beautiful than <a is="ap-nav-link" href="udona">Udona</a> dressed in sturdy, green pants and a shirt.

<p>
	Kodia normally represents an abundance of food and natural resources, though particularly prosperous mines may pay homage to her. However,
	having an abundance of alcohol and tobacco is normally associated with <a is="ap-nav-link" href="axros">Axros's</a> favor.

<h2 id="holy-days">Holy Days</h2>
<p>
	The day after the spring equinox, the Day of Colors, and the day before the harvest begins, Kodia’s Bounty, are holy days for Kodia. The
	Day of Colors is celebrated with public games and sports, such as mile runs, spear throwing, archery competitions, hide and seek, and tag,
	all of which is ended by the sounding of a church bell being rung 5 times, after which the people gather around a feast, typically of
	hunted game, and offer prayers while positioned in strangely ritual-like patterns. Kodia’s Bounty is celebrated with a feast made from
	what little food remains from last years harvest followed up by offerings of chicken, duck and leftover food, which is mixed together then
	used as bait for pig races.
