<h1>Axros, God of Pleasure</h1>
<p>
	Second risen of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="the-three-above">Three Above</a>, Axros is the most popular of the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="the-three-above">Three Above</a>. Axros claimed domain over pleasure after reciting stories he had collected
	through journeying across the entire mortal world to a fey-lord for 7 days straight, in chronological order. Axros is portrayed as a fun
	loving and perpetually cheerful figure. Visual depictions of Axros heavily feature wheat yellow-brown and the warm orange of a tavern
	fire, with Axros himself being portrayed as a portly, monk-like man with a mug of beer and a cheerful, welcoming smile.
</p>
<p>
	While Axros's domain covers sexual pleasure, the god himself prefers to focus on drinking, performances, storytelling, and other
	revelries.

<h2 id="holy-days">Holy Days</h2>
<p>
	Axros has no shared holy days between any two locations. Instead, each settlement will celebrate Axros on the Harrowing, the hardest day
	of the year for them which is usually in the dead of winter, and on Axrosalia, the easiest day of the year for them which is usually just
	after the harvest is finished. These days are celebrated with festivals that start with telling stories around fireplaces, but inevitably
	end wild parties at an establishment that serves alcohol.
</p>
<p>
	The difference between how the Harrowing and Axrosalia are celebrated is that the Harrowing's mid-day festivities have the best athletes
	of the settlement performing public displays of skill and ability, such as shooting an arrow through 8 rings, caber tosses, and dancing
	competitions, while Axrosalia has plays, poetry, and music as the mid-day festivities.
