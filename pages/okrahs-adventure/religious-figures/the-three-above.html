<h1>The Three Above</h1>
<p>
	Commonly abbreviated to "the Risen," the Three Above refer to 3 heroes,
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="udona">Udona, Goddess of Night and Day</a>, <a is="ap-nav-link" href="axros">Axros, God of Pleasure</a>, and
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="kodia">Kodia, Goddess of Abundance</a>, who became gods as part of their adventures. The first to rise,
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="udona">Udona</a>, is generally considered to be leader and strongest member of the Three Above.

	The Three Above don't have defined races and the races chosen for their representations are more often expressions of the artist making
	the piece than any solid description. Often, statues and paintings will match the dominant race in a region, with integrated settlements
	having the Three Above each being a different race, with the race/god choices not matching between art pieces in the same church. The
	commonly held belief as to why is that the Three Above have each risen so long ago that their original race isn't known, while another
	school of thought is that the only people who truly know what race the the Three Above are is those who were in the area they rose at the
	time of their ascension.
