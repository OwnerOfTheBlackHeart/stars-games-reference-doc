<h1>Udona, Goddess of Night and Day</h1>
<p>
	First risen of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="the-three-above">Three Above</a>, Udona claimed governance over night and day after
	singlehandedly slaying the arch-demon Tongrol. Due to her long history as a dedicated wizard, Udona is normally portrayed as a stoic and
	gentle figure. Visual depictions of Udona heavily feature dark purple with golden yellow, with the goddess herself being portrayed as an
	attractive, middle aged female in well fitted mage's robes with a book in hand.

<h2 id="holy-days">Holy Days</h2>
<p>
	Udona's holy days are the equinoxes, Maiden’s Embrace on the spring equinox and the Chill Meet on the fall equinox, when she is said to be
	closest to the mortal world and at her strongest, solstices, the Heated Glare of Udona on the summer solstice and Frost’s Kiss on the
	winter solstice, when she is furthest from the mortal world and at her weakest, and eclipses, which are said to occur when she is
	manifested nearby on the mortal world.
</p>
<p>
	The Maiden’s Embrace and the Chill Meet are celebrated with two feasts each: One at dawn and one at dusk, with decorations depicting the
	sun and moon, which are filled with offerings of incenses, spices and cat hair, being strung about town. The Heated Glare of Udona and
	Frost's Kiss are celebrated by staying home and spending time with family. Leaving one's home during a solstice is considered to be
	inviting trouble as Udona is distant and unable to protect you.
