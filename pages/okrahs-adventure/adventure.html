		<ul>
			<li>
				From the outside, the factory looks like a large, metal dome built at the center of 6 trees. The dome looks sound, though the roof
				has multiple holes in it. The main entrance to the factory has "Facility 11" written above it in fading letters as well as a
				half-opened blast door. An appropriate skill check will reveal that the location of the factory was chosen so as to use the trees
				surrounding it as protection from the hurricane wall.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 1:</b> The entryway to Facility 11 has only dim lighting and several dead animals with burn marks and large nails sticking
				out of them. 2 <a href="#decaying-maintenance-bot">decaying maintenance bots</a> sit at the end of the hallway.

<p>
	The leader of the cult in <a is="ap-nav-link" href="arkala">Arkala</a>, Neimar wields charisma as readily as he wields weapons and spells.
	Despite not wearing armor, Neimar is difficult to strike, which, combined with his demon gifted hammer, makes him a deadly foe.
</p>
<p>
	Neimar's hammer is named Hyarkmeer and is a greathammer + 2.Hyarkmeer's use does come at a cost, however, as activating the magic hammer
	costs 1 system strain, which grants the +2 bonus for 24 hours, after which Hyarkmeer must be fed again in order for its magic to function.
</p>
<p><b>Effort:</b> 4</p>
<p><b>Arts (high mage, pg 67):</b> Sense Magic, Empowered Sorcery, Retain Sorcery, Ward Allies</p>
<p>
	<b>Spells:</b> Neimar can cast 2 spells per day from the following list: The Coruscating Coffin, Damnation of the Sense, Decree of Lithic
	Dissolution, Calculation of the Evoked Servitor

<p>
	Spikeling demons are 2 to 3 foot tall, hunchbacked demons with stone gray skin that seems to be constantly shedding and a "cloak" of 6'
	long spikes on their backs. The arms of a spikeling demon possess blades that appear as if they are made of stone or bone, but are more
	than capable of punching through metal arm. The heads of spikeling demons are disproportionally small in comparison to the rest of their
	bodies.
</p>
<p>
	Spikeling demons possess the ability to eject all their spikes at once, creating a field of arrow-like projectiles around them. As a main
	action, a spikeling demon can deal 2d6 damage to all targets within melee range, no save. After using this ability, the spikeling demon
	loses access to its spike throw attack for 1 minute as its spikes regrow.

<p>
	A 8' 3" tall demon with red-green, sickly looking skin and two tree-trunk like arms, Juphix is the demon to which the demon cult within
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="arkala">Arkala</a> hails to. He has several <a href="#spikeling-demon">spikeling demons</a> at his disposal.
</p>
<p>
	Juphix has the ability to deploy a stunning pulse, a wave of temporary exhaustion. All foes within 30 feet must make a mental save or lose
	their main action for their next round. If the target has a holy symbol or similar divine protection, they gain a +4 on the save roll.
	Juphix can release a stunning pulse in place of one of his normal attacks once every 1d4 turns. 1d4 more turns can be added to the
	cooldown by striking Juphix with holy water or a holy weapon.
