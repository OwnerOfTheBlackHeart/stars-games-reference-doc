			Dear reader, My name is Eneko Criado and 3 days ago [date adjusted by #DATE_UPDATER] my daughter Uxia went missing. She has been
			completely out of contact, not even a text or call back. She works down in the docks and I'm worried that something happened to her
			there. I'm offering 500 credits for her safe return.

			<ul>
				<li>Uxia has been captured by the Threadrippers (symbol is torn shirts) with the intent to be sold as a prostitute.</li>
			</ul>

			Dear reader, My name is Saray PÃ¡ez and I believe the drug den next door has become harmful to the community. I can smell them cooking
			with harsh chemicals at all hours and I've seen the same, slowly decaying customers returning to them over and over again. I don't
			know what they're making, but I'm certain it's too addictive and harmful to be left alone. I'm offering 100 credits if it turns out to
			be me just being paranoid, but if there is something going on, I'll pay 1,000 credits to have it stopped.
		</li>

			General Notice: 300 credits dead, 500 alive<br />
