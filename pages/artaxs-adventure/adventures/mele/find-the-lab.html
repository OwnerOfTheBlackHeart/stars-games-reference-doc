	<a href="#pablo-gilabert">Dr. Gilabert</a> has managed to identify some old ruins hidden beneath

		Artax is asked by <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele-contacts#inez-vivero">Ms. Vivero</a> to help out her friend
		<a href="#pablo-gilabert">Dr. Gilabert</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Artax meets with <a href="#pablo-gilabert">Dr. Gilabert</a>:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="#pablo-gilabert">Dr. Gilabert</a> reveals that he works for, and is a member of, the
				<a hash="#stuj">Scientific Trust for Understanding the Juice</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="#pablo-gilabert">Dr. Gilabert</a> reveals that he's found old ruins that he believes to be from before the Scream, which
				have remained mostly hidden thanks to them being underground and that their security system is still active.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="#pablo-gilabert">Dr. Gilabert</a> believes the ruins to be the tomb of someone important Pre-Scream. He believes that it
				may be one of the first slavers in <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#de-dos">De Dos</a> or an important member of the
				<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="#pablo-gilabert">Dr. Gilabert</a> needs extra muscle to help break through the ruin's defenses and is willing to 2,000
				credits, as well as offer any tools of war that are found within the ruins, as payment.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		The ruin houses members of the <a href="#league-of-separation">League of Separation</a>, who are busy placing traps to capture any
		remaining tomb guards, and has the following rooms:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Room 1:</b> The entrance to this room has a sign on it that says "Dejar Armas en la Papelera" (leave weapons in bin) and has a
				bin next to the door. Once in the room, it is a quiet, peaceful room with calming blue walls and subtle music fills one with inner
				peace. However, if a weapon is brought into the room, a psionic field causes those affected to immediately become hostile to the
				weapon, damaging or destroying it to the best of their ability.
				<ul>
					<li>No enemies in this room</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 2:</b> This room is a beautiful and well made auditorium, using multiple types of stone shaped to carry noises from the
				stage through the entire room. On the "ground floor", over 60 seats provide comfort to those watching and listening, with 4 private
				balconies that seat up to 10 each overlooking the stage. The stage itself is raised enough that all have a clear view of it, which
				currently has only a podium placed upon it. Searching the podium reveals an old ID card for another facility and a "Raging Judge"
				Imperial Arms mag pistol
				<ul>
					<li>2 <a href="#league-soldier">league soldiers</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 3:</b> This room is a mix between an artificial crop field and a hydroponics, with 2 dirt fields growing a fruit tree and
				several smaller fruit bushes while the hydroponics systems taking up the remainder of the room host vegetables, legumes and more. If
				a notice check of DC 9 is beat, then a shear rifle can be found buried in the dirt.
				<ul>
					<li>4 <a href="#tomb-guard-turret">guard turrets</a></li>
					<li>3 <a href="#tomb-guard-bot">guard bots</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 4:</b> This room is a well kept kitchen with 2 dead bodies lying at the entrance. The kitchen itself looks to be made to
				feed even more people than this Tomb should be able to hold. If this room is thoroughly searched, a set of 4 convergence weaponry
				laser SMGs can be found in one of the cabinets.
				<ul>
					<li>2 <a href="#tomb-guard-turret">guard turrets</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 5:</b> This room contains 4 "pens", each of which has a floor which can be electrified and vents for releasing gasses into
				the pens, and an altar at the far end of the room. Above the altar is a picture of Saint Dylan Andrade, the First Unifier, creator
				of the current version of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church#the-juice">Juice</a> that the
				<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a> uses. On the altar, 2 members of the
				<a href="#league-of-separation">League of Separation</a> have been sacrificed, with strange markings being made on and around the
				altar with their blood and small bones pulled from their mutilated bodies.
				<ul>
					<li>1 <a href="#tomb-guard-bot">guard bot</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 6:</b> This room houses a small workshop with random machines, tools and benches assembled together, hinting that it was put
				together by a single person, likely for personal use. Random parts, damaged tools, machines and weapons, and scrap materials litter
				the floor and benches alike. A quick sift of the junk scattered will reveal 3 pieces of pretech scrap and a disabled
				<a href="#tomb-guard-bot">guard bot</a>.
				<ul>
					<li>5 <a href="#league-soldier">league soldiers</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 7:</b> This room houses a large, public bath with a changing room containing 8 stalls and 40 lockers with lanyarded ID keys
				connected to each. Damage to the waterproofing plaster hint at a vicious firefight happening within this room.
				<ul>
					<li>5 <a href="#league-soldier">league soldiers</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 8:</b> This room is not a single room, but a series of tightly connected rooms containing books, computers, small storage
				drives, maps and paper arts (such as drawings and paintings), each sorted and marked according to the Dewey Decimal System. In the
				Sciences room, a painting rests on the end of one of the bookshelves, displaying a priestly looking man with salmon hair with blonde
				highlights (marked Grand Priest Santiago Titenoll on the back), which gives the feeling of hiding something. When one first looks at
				the painting, they must make a mental saving throw or be piloted through room 9 on an almost pre-programmed seeming route, after
				completing which they will be able to see that the background painting hides a map to another site.
				<ul>
					<li>6 <a href="#tomb-guard-turret">guard turrets</a></li>
					<li>1 <a href="#tomb-guard-bot">guard bot</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 9:</b> This room, unlike almost all the other rooms of this tomb, is large and open, containing a well maintained grass
				field with statues of ancient historical saints of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a>. Hidden
				among them is a psionic field that causes one trapped in it to destroy their own mundane equipment, though a notice check of DC 10
				can spot the remains of prior equipment lost to the field.
				<ul>
					<li>4 <a href="#tomb-guard-bot">guard bot</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 10:</b> This room is a finely decorated resting area, with soft cushioned love seats, piles of sitting pillows, sturdy
				dancing poles, a small stage, a bar, and a generally high-class brothel vibe.

	STUJ argue that by understanding <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church#the-juice">Juice</a> it can be used for other purposes,
