	This woman wears a stylish cloak over-top her CFU, in an attempt to protect her from the inevitable gunfire that her presence draws. In
	her hand is a well crafted mag pistol, a symbol of her station and a weapon equally adept at killing her enemies as it is at killing

	Wearing locally sourced clothes, this woman blends in to the crowd, though she seems unwilling to show her eyes. In truth, beneath the
	locally sourced clothes, carefully chosen to best match the locals, the woman is protected by an armored undersuit and armed with a
	revolver. She also has a web of contacts and allies, allowing her to serve as the eyes and ears of the

	A simple "scout" and "light combat" vehicle commonly deployed as an escort to mechanized units by the

	trunk and a gunnery position cut into the top, this combat truck's low manufacturing cost means it frequently finds its way into the

	A light "tank" commonly fielded by the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-peoples-republic-of-cono">People’s Republic of Cono</a> in support of
	mechanized troops, the Koshka is a nimble armored vehicle screams across roads and grasslands on 8 wheels while engaging hard targets with
	it's light cannon. The normal crew load out of the Koshka is a driver, gunner, loader, and commander, who operates the HMG when necessary,
	with the extra 4 crew spaces allowing for the Koshka to carry a small fireteam with it.

<h2>Ms. Inez Vivero</h2>
<p>
	Ms. Vivero was recently contacted by a <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-united-counties-of-polla">pollan</a> soldier by the name of Prasad
	Bose, who wishes to defect (Ms. Vivero promised him a role as a cyber security teacher in her new school). The problem is that he is
	constantly surrounded by other soldiers and has no neutral clothing to allow him to be able to pass into
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#la-contillo">La Contillo</a>
	without being treated as a hostile.
</p>
<p>
	Ms. Vivero will provide Artax with a change of clothes for Prasad and a picture of the man. She will also provide Artax with an ambush
	point for Prasad's patrol.
