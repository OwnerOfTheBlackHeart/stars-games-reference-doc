	After finding a picture of someone that appears to be related to Artax while working with
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-find-the-lab#pablo-gilabert">Dr. Gilabert</a>, Artax found a map leading to an underwater ruin and travels
	there to find answers as to what is going on.

	<li>Artax uses the map she found in the Tomb of Saint Dylan Andrade to travel to the deep sea ruins.</li>
	<li>
		The ruin itself is built onto a continental shelf and supported by pylons connected with earthquake foundation suspension, being made up
		of layers of "glass" bubbles containing buildings within them, allowing the outer sections to appear as observatories. A set of airlocks
		for vehicles of different sizes is placed at the bottom of the ruin.
	</li>
	<li>
		Inside the ruin is cold, but not too much colder than <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#la-contillo">La Contillo</a>, with stale, but
		still breathable air. Half of the ruin, however, seems to be kept much, much colder, at arctic temperatures, though a vacc suit can
		easily overcome the temperatures. Strange (toxic) mists occasionally traverse the hallways, made up of the refrigerant originally used
		to keep the ruin at the correct temperatures. Occasionally the mists take the form of tentacles drifting in the air, seeming to be
		attached to some device.
