	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele-contacts#jaime-leoz">Unifier Leoz</a> has a small handful of problems that require... digression. This
	time, a group of offworlders from the other side of the sector, <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-jimente">Jimente</a>, are trying to
	emancipate slaves and convince melians to join in their drug fueled, atheistic utopia.
</p>
<p>
	As the jiments haven't broken any laws, nothing can be done publicly about them, but
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele-contacts#jaime-leoz">Unifier Leoz</a> believes them to be a heavily disruptive force that has
	purposefully chosen to operate in <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#la-contillo">La Contillo</a> to exploit the distraction the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-united-counties-of-polla">pollans'</a> constant military operations create.
</p>
<p>
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele-contacts#jaime-leoz">Unifier Leoz</a>
	is offering 10,000 credits, but is flexible in payment value and type, so long as the job can be completed discretely.

	Noe is a 5' 8" tall man with a well kept brown mullet, an average build, a spacefarer's complexion and brown eyes. He wears an outfit not
	unlike a Warhammer 40k, complete with overly complicated naval uniform, cloak and massive belt buckle. A smile is always plastered across
	his face.
</p>
<p>
	Noe's objective is to get as many people to take Happy as he can fit into his cargo bays and take back to
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-jimente">Jimente</a> to help in the planetary repopulation effort. He also hopes that planting the seeds of
	emancipation might drive more people to come to <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-jimente">Jimente</a> in thanks.

<p>Noe has a 5" dick.</p>

	What lies underneath the assault suit that makes up the Emancipator is unknown to all but <a href="#noe-pernet">Noe</a>. The suit itself
	is painted to look as if a walking mural of the sky, with the arms being clouds that move as the Emancipator themself does. In armor, the
	Emancipator stands at just under 8 feet tall.
</p>
<p>The Emancipator is a 6' 8" tall man with a 6" dick.</p>

	Wearing colorful clothing and a massive smile, this person is ready to extol the values of everyone being free and the benefits of taking
	the "miracle of joy" that is the drug Happy.

	Clad in basic security armor and armed with laser SMGs, this cheerful person happily stands guard over what they've been assigned to. Even
	when pouring fire into their enemies, they can't seem to stop smiling.
