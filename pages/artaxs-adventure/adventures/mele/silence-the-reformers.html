	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele-contacts#jaime-leoz">Unifier Leoz</a> is concerned that the
	<a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a> movement, a group of "noisy" church reformers, has become more aggressive in its
	teachings lately, openly preaching in the streets and publicly inducting people in mass rituals. He believes
	<a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a> is towing the line of becoming a distablizing force and that they are distorting the
	views of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a>. He would like them dealt with quietly, whether returned
	to the orthodoxy or silently eliminated.

				From the outside, the factory looks like a large, metal dome built at the center of 6 trees. The dome looks sound, though the roof
				has multiple holes in it. The main entrance to the factory has "Facility 11" written above it in fading letters as well as a
				half-opened blast door. An appropriate skill check will reveal that the location of the factory was chosen so as to use the trees
				surrounding it as protection from the hurricane wall.

			<li>
				<b>Room 1:</b> The entryway to Facility 11 has only dim lighting and several dead animals with burn marks and large nails sticking
				out of them. 2 <a href="#decaying-maintenance-bot">decaying maintenance bots</a> sit at the end of the hallway.

			<li>
				<b>Room 2:</b> A small maintenance closet containing various scrapped cleaning machines and empty containers that should hold

			<li>
				<b>Room 3:</b> A small maintenance closet containing a waterlogged post-tech toolkit and a small robot/powered armor maintenance
				stand.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 4:</b> A small factory floor filled with machines large and small, though only a few are in workable condition. The rest are
				either waterlogged or have been scavenged for parts. 4 <a href="#decaying-maintenance-bot">decaying maintenance bots</a> and a

<h2 id="manera-verdadera">The Manera Verdadera Movement</h2>
<p>
	The Manera Verdadera movement is a religious reformist group within the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a> that has discovered how to update the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church#the-juice">Juice</a> to perform a more aggressive transformation, turning all in it into
	feminine hermaphrodites, which the Manera Verdadera believe is the ultimate for of being Unified.
</p>
<p>
	The Manera Verdadera movement is expanding rapidly at the current moment, and is readily sharing both information on how to make their
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church#the-juice">Juice</a> and encouragement to join in their mass induction ceremonies. A
	partial cause of the popularity is the fact that their <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church#the-juice">Juice</a> has a chance to
	make someone more beautiful and/or well endowed, allowing the recipient to reroll all sexual and attractiveness characteristics, taking
	the higher of their current roll or the reroll.
