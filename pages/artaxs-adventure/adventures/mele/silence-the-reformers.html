	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele-contacts#jaime-leoz">Unifier Leoz</a> is concerned that the
	<a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a> movement, a group of "noisy" church reformers, has become more aggressive in its
	teachings lately, openly preaching in the streets and publicly inducting people in mass rituals. He believes
	<a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a> is towing the line of becoming a distablizing force and that they are distorting the
	views of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a>. He would like them dealt with quietly, whether returned
	to the orthodoxy or silently eliminated.

		<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele-contacts#jaime-leoz">Unifier Leoz</a> informs Artax that he is concerned about the sudden expansion

						to find a way to modify the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church#the-juice">Juice</a>, effectively doubling their

						<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a> orthodoxy to more effectively push recruitment.

	<li>
		Artax tracks down the local <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a> congregation:
		<ul>
			<li>
				The congregation meets at a bomb crater turned ampitheater which uses some abandoned, but still standing, houses as storage. The
				ampitheater is well made, but the structure is clearly cheap and easily replaceable, with anything of value stored when not in use.
				The ampitheater has seating for about 300 people, though only about half of the seats are filled.
			</li>
			<li>
				The congregation is more than happy to accept Artax, perhaps even excited at the prospect of gaining the support of a paladin. A
				talk/wisdom or notice/cha check of 8, or better, will reveal that they are excited because a priest of the
				<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a> joining can be seen as validating
				<a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a> as a sect of the
				<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				The congregation is led by a woman named Inez Carderas. Inez is a 5' 1" feminine herm with caramel skin, D cup titties, long curly
				black hair, bright gold eyes and a svelte, almost anorexic, build. When with the congregation, she normally wears a yellow, green
				and pink pulpit gown with heavy jewelry. Inez has a 6" dick and an attractiveness of 10.
			</li>
			<li>
				A <a href="#zhennova-agent">zhennova agent</a> by the name of Yelena Ortov is present at the congregation. Yelena is a 5' 8"
				feminine herm with pale skin, D cup titties, shoulder length brown hair kept in a ponytail, blue-green eyes, and an average build.
				Yelena has a 6" dick and an attractiveness of 8.
			</li>
			<li>
				Investigating the storage areas can reveal that the local <a href="#manera-verdadera">Manera Verdadera</a> congregation is being
				funded by <a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Zhennova</a>, as well as the location of the <a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Zhennova</a> base.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Artax tracks down the location of <a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Zhennova</a>:
		<ul>
			<li>
				The <a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Zhennova</a> base is located in an abandoned
				<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-united-counties-of-polla">pollan</a> forward operating base. Of the base's 2 towers, only 1 remains,
				while the barracks and command building appear to have weathered time unharmed, but the garage has been completely rebuilt, now far
				smaller than the concrete pad it's built on top of. What looks to be the armory is a bank truck parked next to
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quonset_hut" target="_blank">Quonset hut</a> marked maintenance. The wall surrounding the
				base has been repaired, but lacks barbed wire.
			</li>
			<li>
				The base is staffed with 7 fireteams broken down into the following:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b><i>Garage:</i></b> 2 <a href="#zhennova-soldier">zhennova soldiers</a> and 3
						<a href="#zhennova-slave-warrior">zhennova slave warriors</a>, plus 2 <a href="#conesse-technical">conesse technicals</a>.

						<a href="#zhennova-slave-warrior">zhennova slave warriors</a> guarding the building. Inside houses Kapitan Katlina Nikitin and
						Anja Volokh. Investigating the command office reveals:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Zhennova</a> has been steadily growing from it's original 10 members, up to the 16 current
								members
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Zhennova</a> knew that it, at it's current size, didn't pose a threat to
								<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#la-contillo">La Contillo</a> at their current size, but plans are laid for operations
								intended to drive recruitment, damage <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#la-contillo">La Contillo's</a> ability to respond,
								and make full use of <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-peoples-republic-of-cono">conesse</a> support to create an environment
								for eventual <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-peoples-republic-of-cono">conesse</a> reinforcements.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Zhennova</a> has been supplied by a small naval task force lead by a
								<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele-enemies#olena-gurov">Kovnik</a> Gurov.

			</li>
			<li>
				The "kapitan" of the base is Katlina Nikitin, a <a href="#zhennova-soldier">zhennova soldier</a> with 3 hit dice, +3 to hit, +1 to
				damage and a morale of 9. Katlina is a 5' 9" feminine hermaphrodite with pale white skin, E (DD) cup titties, short, blonde hair,
				brown eyes, and an athletic build. Katlina has an attractiveness of 9.
			</li>
			<li>
				The base also houses Anja Volokh, a <a href="#conesse-bvb-agent">conesse BVB agent</a>. She is a 5' 8" female with tanned-yellow
				skin, B cup titties, a reddish-brown mullet with braided bangs that frame her face, silver eyes, and an average build. Anja has an

<h4 id="manera-verdadera">The Manera Verdadera Movement</h4>
<p>
	The Manera Verdadera movement is a religious reformist group within the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a> that has discovered how to update the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church#the-juice">Juice</a> to perform a more aggressive transformation, turning all in it into
	feminine hermaphrodites, which the Manera Verdadera believe is the ultimate for of being Unified.
</p>
<p>
	The Manera Verdadera movement is expanding rapidly at the current moment, and is readily sharing both information on how to make their
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church#the-juice">Juice</a> and encouragement to join in their mass induction ceremonies. A
	partial cause of the popularity is the fact that their <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church#the-juice">Juice</a> has a chance to
	make someone more beautiful and/or well endowed, allowing the recipient to reroll all sexual and attractiveness characteristics, taking
	the higher of their current roll or the reroll. Major monetary donations from <a href="#zhenshchiny-snova">Women Again</a> hasn't hurt
	either.
</p>

<h4 id="zhenshchiny-snova">Zhenshchiny Snova/Women Again</h4>
<p>
	Zhenshchiny Snova, or Women Again, or abbreviated to Zhennova, is a rebel group primarily made up of refugees from
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#cono">Cono</a> who were "forcibly" turned into hermaphrodites, whether immigrants or escaped
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church#slavery">slaves</a>. Most members of Zhennova wish to be able to be turned back into women
	and return to <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#cono">Cono</a>, though some of the more zealous members have managed to recruit locals to
	join Zhennova's cause.
</p>
<p>
	Zhennova, while a destabilizing rebel force that is preparing to actively attack the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a>, does have some good arguments for their side, namely that
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church#the-juice">Deunification</a> should be more readily available.
</p>
<p>
	Zhennova is primarily supplied by the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-peoples-republic-of-cono">People’s Republic of Cono</a>, who provides
	arms, armor, ammo, and training to the rebel group.
