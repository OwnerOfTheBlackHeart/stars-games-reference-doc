<p>
	The planet Mele is a temperate, Earth-like world with 3 primary continents: Polla, Cono, <a href="#de-dos">De Dos</a>. Polla, ruled by the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-united-counties-of-polla">United Counties of Polla</a>, is a highly patriarchal, highly aggressive
	government driven by conquest and material gains. Cono, ruled by the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-peoples-republic-of-cono">Peopleâ€™s Republic of Cono</a>, is a highly matriarchal government driven primarily
	toward internal policy and technological development, even if most of the technology is just for show and corruption runs rampant.
	<a href="#de-dos">De Dos</a>, ruled by the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a>, is ruled by a government
	that generally support libertarian ideals with a strong focus on communities supporting each other, which is ruled over by people who
	willingly undergo genetic modification to become The Unified (hermaphrodites).
</p>
<p>
	A common thread among all three continents is that their ruling governments use religion to justify their existence and to justify the
	oppression of at least one sex (<a href="#de-dos">De Dos</a> is notably less oppressive towards those who refuse Unification). The
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a>, which rules over <a href="#de-dos">De Dos</a>, heavily preaches
	personal freedoms and strength of community, as well as pushing, but not forcing, a ritual known as Unification, in which an individual is
	genetically modified into a fully functioning hermaphrodite.
</p>
<p>
	Despite the focus on freedom and community service, the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a> supports a strong slave trade, viewing criminals and captured
	soldiers as having given up their humanity and became property. Those who become slaves are forced to undergo the Unification, regardless
	of how willing they are.

<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>
<h3 id="de-dos">De Dos</h3>
<p>
	Ranging from the norther sub-arctic region to the southern sub-tropical region, <a href="#de-dos">De Dos</a> has climates ranging from
	hot, sandy deserts to taigas to temperate rainforests. <a href="#de-dos">De Dos</a> is ruled by the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a>, and is home to Mele's largest reserves of rare metals.
</p>

<h4 id="vedia">Vedia</h4>
<p>
	A smallish, flooded city located in the center of Lake El Amor, built around the pyramid-like mansion where the original settlers of Vedia
	built their homes. From this, a fish farming city sprawls around the city center, which eventually leads to the river Regar, the largest
	river in central <a href="#de-dos">De Dos</a>. At the point where Lake El Amor and the river Regar meet, on the western side of the Lake
	El Amor, closest to the rising sun, is located the Carcora Temple of the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a>, which works to ensure the cleanliness of the river Regar by
	filtering out trash and junk from the delta, then restoring/refurbishing it into salable products.
</p>
<h4 id="la-contillo">La Contillo</h4>
<p>
	A fortified city made primarily from reinforced buildings and bunkers, La Contillo is a major military port city for
	<a href="#de-dos">De Dos</a> on the north-eastern shore, and is the closest point to
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-united-counties-of-polla">Polla</a>. Due to the military focus of La Contillo, it frequently sees attack by
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-united-counties-of-polla">Pollan</a> forces, but just as equally sees templars journey to it in hope of
	capturing <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-united-counties-of-polla">Pollan</a> slaves.
