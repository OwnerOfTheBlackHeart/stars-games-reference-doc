	A light "tank" commonly fielded by the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-peoples-republic-of-cono">People’s Republic of Cono</a> in support of
	mechanized troops, the Koshka is a nimble armored vehicle screams across roads and grasslands on 8 wheels while engaging hard targets with
	it's light cannon. The normal crew load out of the Koshka is a driver, gunner, loader, and commander, who operates the HMG when necessary,
	with the extra 4 crew spaces allowing for the Koshka to carry a small fireteam with it.
