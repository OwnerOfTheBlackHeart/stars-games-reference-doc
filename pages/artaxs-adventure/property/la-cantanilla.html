<h1>La Cantanilla</h1>
<p>
	A small fortification built by the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-peoples-republic-of-cono">Conesse</a> and captured by Artax. The current
	state of La Cantanilla is that of a several tents set up within the perimeter of a wall of metal plates supported by dirt and sand bags,
	with a single set of double doors, made of rough timbers bound together by three metal bars each and powered by electric motors, allowing
	vehicle entry, though one of the double doors has been burned down.
</p>
<p>
	The remaining tents are the command tent, which is the largest tent and currently being used to handle excess storage, a single ammo dump
	tent, a set of 4 barracks tents, a kitchen tent, and the garage tent, which has an attached portable garage large enough for 3 military
	vehicles.
</p>

<h2 id="upgrades">Upgrades</h2>
<p>
	Every upgrade has a number of man hours required to complete it, for which 1 worker provides 8 man hours per day. Trained workers provide
	12 man hours per day, and experts in the field of construction provide 16 man hours per day. Having a trained foreman on the project adds
	1 man hour per worker per day, while a foreman that is an expert in the field of construction provides 2 man hours per day per worker.
</p>
<p>
	Some upgrades require credits to purchase the raw materials needed for the project, though this cost can be reduced or negated if the raw
	materials can be gathered through another means. Those upgrades listed without credit costs can be built once with materials available
	within the base, though building more than 1 will require external supplies.
</p>
<p>
	Most upgrades have some form of equipment that can speed up construction. The Crane requirement refers to a vehicle mounted crane, while
	the Cement Truck requirement requires a full, industrial cement mixer truck, though a pickup truck mounted with a cement mixer provides
	half of the benefit. The Workshop requirement requires the <a href="#utilities">Workshop</a> upgrade to gain the full benefit, though a
	vehicle mounted with a portable workshop provides half the listed benefit.
