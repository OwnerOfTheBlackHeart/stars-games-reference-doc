<h1>La Cantanilla</h1>
<p>
	A small fortification built by the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-peoples-republic-of-cono">Conesse</a> and captured by Artax. The current
	state of La Cantanilla is that of a several tents set up within the perimeter of a wall of metal plates supported by dirt and sand bags,
	with a single set of double doors, made of rough timbers bound together by three metal bars each and powered by electric motors, allowing
	vehicle entry, though one of the double doors has been burned down.
</p>
<p>
	The remaining tents are the command tent, which is the largest tent and currently being used to handle excess storage, a single ammo dump
	tent, a set of 4 barracks tents, a kitchen tent, and the garage tent, which has an attached portable garage large enough for 3 military
	vehicles.
</p>

<h2 id="upgrades">Upgrades</h2>
<p>
	Every upgrade has a number of man hours required to complete it, for which 1 worker provides 8 man hours per day. Trained workers provide
	12 man hours per day, and experts in the field of construction provide 16 man hours per day. Having a trained foreman on the project adds
	1 man hour per worker per day, while a foreman that is an expert in the field of construction provides 2 man hours per day per worker.
</p>
<p>
	Some upgrades require credits to purchase the raw materials needed for the project, though this cost can be reduced or negated if the raw
	materials can be gathered through another means. Those upgrades listed without credit costs can be built once with materials available
	within the base, though building more than 1 will require external supplies.
</p>
<p>
	Most upgrades have some form of equipment that can speed up construction. The Crane requirement refers to a vehicle mounted crane, while
	the Cement Truck requirement requires a full, industrial cement mixer truck, though a pickup truck mounted with a cement mixer provides
	half of the benefit. The Workshop requirement requires the <a href="#utilities">Workshop</a> upgrade to gain the full benefit, though a
	vehicle mounted with a portable workshop provides half the listed benefit.

	<b id="slave-cot">Slave cots</b> are cheap, uncomfortable cots given to only the lowest of the low. They rarely have any form of storage,
	with the lucky slave having a small storage net underneath their cot that can hold clothes, or similarly soft objects.
</p>
<p>
	<b id="military-cot">Military cots</b> are quick to set up and comfortable enough for a cranky soldier to sleep on. Military cots come
	with a small storage locker, either at the foot of the cot or as part of a mass of lockers.
</p>
<p>
	<b id="civilian-cot">Long term civilian cots</b> come with either a lightweight, inflatable mattress, or similar comforts, and are large
	enough for a civilian to use them for a few months with only mild complaints. Civilian cots also come with a steamer trunk, a set of
	dresser drawers, standing closet, armoire or wardrobe for holding clothes and personal effects.
</p>
<p>
	<b id="military-bedroom">Military bedrooms</b> are small, cramped affairs with a cheap, hotel-like bed and a closet, or furniture that
	serves as one, for storing clothes and personal effects. To a soldier, these affairs may be their only place of rest for years, but to a
	civilian, such rooms are considered barely habitable.
</p>
<p>
	<b id="civilian-bedroom">Civilian bedrooms</b> are large enough for a civilian to stretch with a bed large enough for an adult and a
	child, a closet and enough room to have a set of dresser drawers or a small entertainment center. Single adults, children, or single
	parents will find such an abode to be sufficient for their needs, but often dream of having more... damn needy civilians.
</p>
<p>
	<b id="good-bedroom">Good bedrooms</b> are large enough to house a bed that can fit two adults comfortably and two sets of dresser
	drawers, with a walk-in closet, pair of closets, or wide closet sufficient enough to hold the clothing and effects of said adults. To
	standard civilian couple, this is the desired sleeping arrangement. Some may even include a cramped bathroom with an equally cramped
	shower or a bathroom without a shower.
</p>
<p>
	<b id="elite-bedroom">Elite bedrooms</b> are large enough to house a bed that can fit three adults (though normally only 2 sleep in one),
	a walk-in closet with standing mirrors or equally decedent method for storing clothes, room enough for a desk, two sets of dresser drawers
	and a small entertainment center with walking space. Elite bedrooms also come with a "master" bathroom, though the shower is either a
	standing shower or cramped. Dreamed of by the middle class and the normal sleeping accommodations of the upper-middle class to lower-upper
	class, the vast majority of civilians will be more than satisfied with such an abode.
</p>
<p>
	<b id="peerless-bedroom">Peerless bedroom</b> house a bed big enough to comfortably fit 5 people (though normally only 2 sleep in one),
	multiple walk-in closets with mirrors, or a single, massive walk-in closet with room enough for a large desk, two sets of dresser drawers
	and a full entertainment center with a projector or holo-unit, high-quality speaker system and a computer, with enough walking space to
	comfortably seat a small crowd. The master bathroom of peerless bedrooms match the primary bathrooms of lesser homes, with a full shower,
	usually including massage jets and/or a fancy showerhead, multiple sinks, a toilet with plentiful knee space, and enough room to be used
	by 3, or more, people at once. This abode will satisfy politicians and celebrities, with only spoiled monarchs, wealthy oligarchs, the
	scions of multi-billion credit companies and high profile celebrities complaining about such accommodations, though such persons are
	willing to accept the normal peerless bedroom as a temporary affair.
