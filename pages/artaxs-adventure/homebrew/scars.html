<h1>Scars Homebrew System</h1>
<p>
	The system presented below is intended to serve as a way for scaring from combat to be handled mechanically. This system is entirely
	optional and, for the most part, cosmetic. This ruleset is mainly intended to be used with players, and player adjacent NPCs. Don't feel
	the need to constantly track if the random hobo serial killer the party is fighting is taking scars from their attacks.
</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-scar">What is a Scar?</h2>
<p>
	For the sake of this rule set, a scar is a combat injury that has resulted in a permanent blemish on the skin, also known as a scar. Every
	scar, as tracked by this system, as two values: The weapon that caused it and the location that it occurred on the body. Having a scar in
	any particular area doesn't apply mechanical penalties or benefits, but may, at GM's discretion, apply a bonus or penalty during
	interactions with NPCs, depending on their opinions on scars.

<h2 id="how-are-scars-gained">How are Scars Gained?</h2>
<div class="homebrew-example">
	<p>Alex is playing James, who is stuck in the unfortunate situation of being in a gunfight, inside a burning building.</p>
	<p>
		As an example, if James is caught in a fire, dealing 1d6 points of damage per turn for 3 turns (dealing 3, 2, and 5 damage), wearing
		only an armored undersuit, James is at risk of gaining a scar from the first and third round of fire damage. James also takes 6 damage
		from a lucky laser pistol on the first turn, so he is also at risk of a scar from the attack.
	</p>
	<p>
		When dealt the 3 damage from the fire, James has to roll a physical save, since the 3 damage is equal to the minimum damage (3) required
		to be at risk of a scar while wearing street armor. Alex calculates that James has a penalty of 0 (3 damage - 3 minimum damage) to his
		physical save, meaning James'll need to roll a 12 to avoid being scared. He rolls an 11. When Alex repeats the process for the laser
		pistol shot and the third round of fire damage, he rolls a 5 for the laser pistol shot (penalty of 3, 6 damage - 3 minimum damage) and a
		15 for the third round of fire damage, successfully passing.
	</p>
	<p>
		When James fails the saving throw for the first round of fire damage, Alex rolls 1d8 and compares it to the damage area table. He rolls
		a 1, then rolls 1d10, rolling 3. Alex denotes on James's sheet that he's taken a scar to his face, right eye from fire. James repeats
		the process when he's hit with the laser pistol, getting a 7 and a 2. Alex denotes that James has taken a scar on his right leg from a
		laser pistol.
	</p>
	<p>
		After the combat has completed, Alex takes some time to figure out what type of scars James has taken. He decides that the scar on his
		right eye is a burn scar on the eyelid from a cinder getting caught in the eyelid, and that the laser pistol scar on his right leg is a
		nasty laser scar on the inner thigh, that wasn't that far off from ending James's career early. Alex decides that these new scars have
		taught James to be more cautious when picking fights.
	</p>
	<p>
		Two sessions later, James is trying to fake his way into a rich kids party to assassinate the kid's father. When James approaches the
		bouncer to get in, the GM decides to roll a notice roll for the bouncer to see if he is able to see the scar on James right eye. The
		bouncer rolls a natural 12, more than enough for him to notice the subtle scar. The GM decides that James will have a +1 to all DCs when
		attempting social rolls with this bouncer, as the bouncer is suspicious of the scar.
	</p>
</div>
<p>
	Every time a character is hit with enough damage, they have a chance of gaining a scar. Regardless of if the damage is from an attack or
	environmental damage, they only roll against the single "tick" of damage. An unarmored character with no bonuses to their innate AC is at
	risk of gaining a scar if they are dealt 2, or more, damage, a character in street armor is at risk of gaining a scar if they are dealt 3,
	or more, damage, a character in combat armor, or who gains innate AC bonuses (such as from Ironhide or Alien Foci Natural Defenses AC) if
	they are dealt 5, or more, damage, and a character in powered armor is at risk of gaining a scar if they are dealt 10, or more, damage.
</p>
<p>
	When a character is at risk for a scar, they roll a physical save with a penalty equal to the damage dealt minus the minimum damage of
	their armor. If they succeed on the save, the character does not get a scar. If the character fails their save, roll 1d8 and compare the
	result to the table below, then denote the location and the weapon used on the character's scar table/note.

<h2 id="removing-scars">Removing Scars</h2>
<p>
	Scars are easily removable, but with the advent of TL 4 medicine, some relief has come for those who with to free themselves from their
	scars. Removing a scar normally costs 100 credits per scar removed on a TL 4 world, with a day of rest afterword to recover from the
	treatments. If a character undergoes the Body Sculpting cyberware installation procedure, the have the option to keep their scars, have
	scars added, and have scars removed, all at no extra cost.
</p>

<h2 id="starting-with-scars">Starting with Scars</h2>
<p>
	If you want to see if a character starts with scars, roll 1d8-4 to determine the number of scars, with a 0, or less, representing a lack
	of scars. Roll the scar locations as normal, then determine what cause would be most appropriate. If the character has lived a life that's
	likely to have left them scared, you can roll either a 1d4-1 or a 1d6-2, whichever is more fitting.
