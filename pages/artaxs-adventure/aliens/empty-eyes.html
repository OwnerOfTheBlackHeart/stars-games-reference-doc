<h1>The Empty Eyes/Citreum Kaoutii (key-out-tee)</h1>
<p>
	The Empty Eyes, or Citreum Kaoutii as they would call themselves, are a race of Lost that had arrived on
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele">Mele</a> before the Scream. The name Empty Eyes comes from when the first humans who met the kaoutii
	and believed that their eyes seemed empty and devoid of thought.
</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	The kaoutii are generally humanoid in size and shape with soft, charcoal black skin (like that of a polar bear) protruded by plates of ice
	that cover their torso arms and legs like armor and digitigrade legs that they slowly rock back and forth on. To get from place to place,
	the kaoutii rarely walk, instead teleporting short distances, running when they need to travel faster than their natural teleportation
	allows. Kaoutii have a strangely floral smell about them and communicate using fluting vocalizations that have a slightly wind-like sound
	to them.
</p>
<p>
	For clothing, the kaoutii prefer layered robes, not dissimilar to the ceremonial robes used by the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a>. The kaoutii favor the inclusion of flowing lines and circles in
	their architecture and art.
</p>
<p>
	Individual kaoutii require a sense of community or become sickly over the course of a month, perspiring if they remain without a sense of
	community for longer than 6 months. They can recover from a lack of sense of community within 1 to 2 weeks, depending on the age and
	general health of the individual.
</p>
<p>
	The kaoutii have a strong, but not overwhelming, desire to unify all things, to bring everything into perfect conjunction and harmony to
	create one harmonious and, in their eyes, perfect community.
</p>

<h3 id="culture-and-government">Culture and Government</h3>
<p>
	The kaoutii on <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele">Mele</a> built their families around commercial cabals, viewing those they worked with
	as a stronger bond then blood. They also were friendly and welcoming to outsiders, whether from other cabals or from other races, secretly
	hiding a strong sense of paranoia that drove them to befriend and ally themselves with as many as possible, as a close friend wouldn't
	intentionally harm you.
</p>
<p>
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele">Melan</a> kaoutii culture also favored piety in "gentle" faiths, while portraying fleeing from battle
	as one of the worst ways that an individual can abandon their community and cabal.
</p>
<p>
	The "government" of the kaoutii on <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele">Mele</a> was one where the few "free" kaoutii used coded
	programming implanted in the general population during general education to control and direct the various cabals in their original quest
	to gather materials.
</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>
	Before the Scream, the kaoutii spread out from their native tundras on their homeworld of Yovyke into a reasonably powerful hegemon, from
	which the Terran Mandate appears to have only encountered scattered, distant colonies.
</p>
<p>
	The kaoutii that came to <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele">Mele</a> were tasked with exploiting deep sea resources. Unfortunately, when
	the kaoutii first arrived on <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele">Mele</a>, the planet's oceans were plagued by a dramatic uptick in
	tectonic and seismic activity, forcing the kaoutii to adapt their structures to survive the violent earthquakes until the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele">Mele</a> returned to its normal level of tectonic activity.
</p>
<p>
	The fall of the kaoutii on <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele">Mele</a> began when a small sect of the population began diving into
	strange truths about reality that they believed to could lead to new ways to spread unity. Unfortunately, these truths brought proper
	madness to those that learned them, but the kaoutii leadership proved apathetic to the spreading truths, eventually leading to the death
	of the last kaoutii on <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele">Mele</a> on the eve of the Scream.

	<p>
		The kaoutiis' obsession with unity began when a long lost alien race deployed a powerful propaganda campaign that preyed on the
		kaoutiis' need for a sense of community to convince them that they needed to work on creating one great super community, as a way to
		distract the kaoutii from the producers of the propaganda campaign.
