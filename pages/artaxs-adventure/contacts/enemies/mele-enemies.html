	<p>
		Soviet Korovin is a 5' 10" female with pale skin, D cup titties, ass-length, straight green hair, pink eyes, and plentiful fat. Korovin
		normally wears fine suits and beautiful dresses, all "expensive" and all in the latest fashion, with as much jewelry as she can fit
		without "ruining the look."
	</p>
	<p>
		<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-peoples-republic-of-cono#soviet">Soviet</a> Korovin seeks to use the conflict between the
		<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a> and the
		<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-united-counties-of-polla">United Counties of Polla</a> to gain a territorial holding on
		<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#de-dos">De Dos</a>, which she can then use to gather materials, produce private goods, and have a
		"safe" holding, away from the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-peoples-republic-of-cono">Peoples' Republic's</a>
		internal politics. Such a holding would also make for an excellent location to arm and train her private military without anyone
		noticing.

		<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-peoples-republic-of-cono#kovnik">Kovnik</a> Gurov ia a 5' 2" female with pale skin, E (DD) titties, blue
		hair, typically kept in a bun under her cap or helmet, purple eyes, and strongwoman's physique.
		<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-peoples-republic-of-cono#kovnik">Kovnik</a> Gurov is almost never seen out of her military wear, whether
		it is her dress blues (which she wears when commanding a ship), her combat armor, or army casual (a t-shirt with cargo or basketball
		shorts).

	<p>
		<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-peoples-republic-of-cono#kovnik">Kovnik</a> Gurov serves
		<a href="#ekaterina-korovin">Soviet Korovin</a> almost directly, despite not officially being under her control, as Gurov's family lives
		in <a href="#ekaterina-korovin">Soviet Korovin's</a> okrug. Gurov does so hoping that her service, and potentially success, will inspire
		<a href="#ekaterina-korovin">Soviet Korovin</a> to give her family special treatment.
