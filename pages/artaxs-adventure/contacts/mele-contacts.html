<p>
	Unifier Jaime Leoz is the Unifier (a mix of priest and mayor) of <a href="art-mele#la-contillo">La Contillo</a>. As an unfortunate side
	effect of being the Unifier of <a href="art-mele#la-contillo">La Contillo</a>, much of Jaime's job is maintaining the support
	infrastructure for the Grand Paladin's army.
</p>
<p>
	Jaime is a 5' 11" tall, human masculine hermaphrodite with thigh length purple hair, an average build, yellowish-red skin and light blue
	eyes. He normally wears a yellow and bright red set of pulpit gown with minimal jewelry. While Jaime has a sleeve tattoo from his youth,
	he doesn't display it unless asked.
</p>
<p>Jaime has 2 feminine slaves, Devora Romasko and Jacinta Quesada, who are kept busy serving as assistants.</p>
