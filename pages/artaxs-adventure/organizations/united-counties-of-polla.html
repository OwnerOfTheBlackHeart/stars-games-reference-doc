<h1>The United Counties of Polla</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	The government that rules over the continent of <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#polla">Polla</a>, the United Counties of Polla is a
	parliamentary republic ruled by the King, who is elected by the Parliament upon the death or retirement of the previous king from the
	eligible relatives of the prior king, and the Parliament. The United Counties is both patriarchal and aggressive, driven primarily by
	conquest and material gains.
</p>
<p>
	The King is the official ruler of the United Counties of Polla and serves as the commander-in-chief, however, the King is still held
	accountable to the Parliament. By the same token, when issues occur in the Parliament, the King has the power to step in and serve as a
	neutral party, either by casting a weighted vote or by working with the opposing sides within Parliament to come to a compromise. The King
	also has the ability to call upon emergency powers in times of crisis, such as during heavy warfare or during natural disasters.
</p>
<p>
	The Parliament serves as the legislature of the United Counties of Polla, and is elected from the populace, with each "county" having one
	representative in the Parliament. The main job of the Parliament is to write laws and handle the internal affairs of the United Counties,
	but the Parliament also has limited vetoing power over the King, the ability to, with no less than a 3/4 vote, remove the King from the
	throne, and the responsibility of electing a new King from the eligible relatives of the prior King. By the same token, any law the
	Parliament writes can be vetoed by the King and the head of the Parliament, the Chancellor, can be removed from power by the King.
</p>
<p>
	The United Counties of Polla derives its name from the founding body being 6 counties from 4 different countries coming together in order
	to take over the entire continent of <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#polla">Polla</a>, which was accomplished through a mix of
	diplomacy, manipulation of religion, and through a military might that kept growing all the way until they controlled the entirety of
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#polla">Polla</a>.

<h3 id="women">Women in <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#polla">Polla</a></h3>
<p>
	Women in <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#polla">Polla</a> come in two legal "variants": Owned and free. Owned women are those who are
	either married, who are owned by their husbands, or are youths, who are owned by their father or their closest adult male relative. Free
	women are the unmarried adult women and are normally limited to jobs in the medical, food service, and cleaning industries. Women can also
	pursue careers in prostitution, either selling themselves for pleasure or as child bearers to unmarried men, or infertile couples. Most
	men can only have one wife, though men who make 100,000 credits per year, or more, are allowed to have another wife for every 50,000
	credits they make per year.
</p>
<p>
	Women in the military are either criminals who were given military service as punishment, those physical specimens too good to pass up,
	emergency conscripts, or women voluntarily serving in a normal "female" position. Women in combat positions are always placed into cannon
	fodder type units, with men making up the NCO and officers. Such units are poorly equipped in terms of vehicular assets and the women get
	only the most basic of combat training.
