<h1>The Unitarian Church</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	Both the government of <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#de-dos">De Dos</a> and a fully blown religious institution, the Unitarian Church
	is what foreigners think of when one mentions <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#de-dos">De Dos</a>. The Church maintains order throughout
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#de-dos">De Dos</a> via a mix of policy, social influence, and the Paladins, who serve primarily as the
	police of the Unitarian Church, and can be roamers (who travel from city to city in order to grow in skill, wealth and servants/slaves) or
	settled (who serve a local community, in a variety of roles). The military of the Unitarian Church is primarily lead by Paladins decided
	to join the military over becoming settled and is made up of volunteers (who make up the "federal" troops), paladins (who may be
	conscripted as needed locally, or who may join as special forces or military leadership), and local defense forces, though general
	conscription can occur, but only in dire circumstances. While they have a more militant focus, Paladins are considered fully fledged
	clergy and have all the normal rights and capabilities as a normal priest of the Unitarian Church.
</p>
<p>
	The beliefs of the Unitarian Church focus around the power of the individual and the greater power of the community, pushing forth
	libertarian ideals and the ideals of communities supporting each other. This belief in unity and collective betterment leads the Unitarian
	Church to push forth a policy of favoritism to hermaphrodites, referred to as the Unified and created via a ritual known as Unification,
	viewing only having one sex as limiting one's ability to benefit the community. Adults must be Unified in order to serve the Unitarian
	Church in any fashion.
</p>
<p>
	Despite their focus on freedom and community service, the Unitarian Church supports a strong slave trade, viewing criminals and captured
	soldiers as having given up their humanity and became property. Those who become slaves are forced to undergo the Unification, regardless
	of how willing they are.
</p>
<p>The colors of the Unitarian Church are green and yellow, with bright red replacing green for high ranking non-military officials.</p>

<h3 id="unification">Unification</h3>
<p>
	The ritual of Unification is a strongly encouraged, but optional, ritual that any adult can have performed on them at a Unitarian Church
	temple, which turns them into a Unified (hermaphrodite) via genetic manipulation. The ritual is performed in special rooms, known as
	Dunkers, which have a tank large enough for 2, or more, people to comfortably stand in, which may either have stairs in, and out, or a
	grate which is capable of being lowered into and raised out of the tank. In the Dunker's tank is a fluid, typically green, blue or brown
	and slightly thicker than water, known as The Juice, The Goop, or even The Sludge, though the Unitarian Church refers to it as the Juice.
	The Juice is the actual compound which preforms the genetic and physical modification to turn a person Unified, and must be taken into the
	lungs in order to take effect, though it has no effect on a Unified person.
</p>
<p>
	The ritual itself begins with a priest and all participants stripping naked in the Dunker. The priest then enters the tank first, standing
	off to the side of the center of the tank, after which the participants, one at a time, enter the tank, either via the stairs or by
	standing on the tanks grate and being lowered in. Once the participant is in the center of the Dunker's tank, the priest tells the
	participant to breathe and not swallow before dunking their head, nose up, into the Juice and holds the participant still for roughly 30
	seconds (Paladins are known to commonly hold participants under for 45 seconds). Once the participant is released, they will cough up
	excess Juice and will wheeze several times, after which the participant will leave the tank, either via the stairs or by the grate lifting
	them out of the tank, as a fully functioning Unified. If the participant doesn't wheeze upon rising out of the Juice, the priest will
	re-submerge them until they complete the ritual successfully. All participants and the priest are required to remain naked until all
	participants have become Unified and the priest has exited the tank, though it is typical for the priest to either lead the participants
	in a prayer or meditation session after the Unification before they are allowed to become clothed again.
</p>
<p>
	The officially stated reason for the nudity requirement of the ritual of Unification is that it helps the participants become closer and
	more comfortable with each other, creating a stronger community.
</p>
<p>
	The Juice used in the ritual of Unification is poorly understood in how it functions, but is able to be mass produced by the Unification
	Church across
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#de-dos">De Dos</a>. A Deunification ritual and Juice do exist, but one must travel to the First Temple
	of the Unification Church in order to be Deunified.
</p>
<p>Those who refuse Unification or who have been Deunified are viewed with pity, rather than contempt, by the Unitarian Church.</p>

<h3 id="slavery">Slavery in the Unification Church</h3>
<p>
	The slavery system of the Unification Church is segmented into four levels: slave, servant, knave, and paige. A "fifth" and "sixth" rank
	exist, that being immigrant and citizen. While immigrants have all the same rights and protections as a citizen, they are considered
	unbound to a community and don't have access to certain government services or the ability to serve as a member of the Unification Church.
	Being a citizen gives full access to all government services, protections and freedoms offered by the Unification Church and enables a
	member to become a member of the Unification Church if they are Unified. In order to become a citizen, an adult must first choose a
	community (such as a town or city) to join and then find the Unifier (a mix of priest and mayor) and pledge themselves to the community,
	after which point they are considered a full citizen.
</p>
<p>
	Slaves have the least freedom of the 4 levels of slavery, and are those who have committed crimes equal to murder or rape, or have
	attacked a Paladin while being detained (such as those captured during active battles). If the slave committed a severe crime, they belong
	to the victim, or the victim's closest relative, should the victim be dead. Otherwise, the slave belongs to the Paladin that captured
	them. Slaves have no rights and may be killed at their master's digression. Being a slave is lifelong service, and a slave can be sold or
	traded.
</p>
<p>
	Servants are the second least protected level of slavery, and are those enemies of the Unitarian Church who have willingly surrendered.
	They belong to the priest, or Paladin, they surrendered to. Servants are guaranteed safety from their masters, but can be treated poorly
	or punished. Being a servant is a lifelong service, but a servant can be sold or traded, but requires a form be filled out and approved by
	the communities of both the owner and the recipient.
</p>
<p>
	Knaves are the second most protected level of slavery, and are those who have committed minor crimes, or have otherwise been judged in
	need of correction by a Paladin or Unifier. Knaves are guaranteed safety from their masters and can be punished, but not harshly. A knave
	serves for a duration that matches their crime. Knaves are owned by those who were the victim of their crime(s) and have a limited
	duration of servitude based on the crime(s) they committed. Knaves cannot be sold or traded, but can be released from service.
</p>
<p>
	A paige is the most protected level of slavery and is more of a training rank than anything else. Paiges serve under officials or members
	of the Unitarian Church in order to learn the position of their "owner," and normally serve as an assistant during their paigehood.
	Paigehood ends when a paige is either dubbed worth of the position they are training for, or if they are serving under an official, when
	their mentor steps down. Paiges are still considered to be full citizens of the Unitarian Church, and may leave paigehood at any time.
</p>
<p>
	Paladins and Unifiers have the right to make people slaves, servants, or knaves, but are held accountable if they are found to have
	falsely forced a person into a level of slavery they don't deserve. This may result in reparations, knavehood, or, in extreme cases,
	execution of the Paladin or Unifier. While their are no checks and balances when a Paladin or Unifier makes an enemy a slave, if they make
	a criminal, citizen, servant or knave a slave, they are given a 60 day grace period, during which their claim for enslavement is reviewed
	by the Unitarian Church. If the claim is found to be false, the Paladin or Unifier is held accountable, and may be required to pay
	reparations, serve as the victim's knave, or worse, if they have killed the slave during the grace period.
