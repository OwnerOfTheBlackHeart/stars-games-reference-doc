<h1>The People's Republic of Cono</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	The government that runs the continent of <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#cono">Cono</a>, the People's Republic of Cono is a
	matriarchal communist state driven towards internal policies and showy, technological development. The internal policies tend to focus on
	the government retaining power over the people and ensuring that men have no capacity to revolt against the regime, while the
	technological development is often little more than a show of "progress" that, at best, finds its way into the hands of the elite members
	of the party.
</p>
<p>
	The People's Republic of Cono is corrupt throughout most levels of the government, all the way to Premier Tsaryova Victorovna. This is
	most visible in the "economy" of the People's Republic of Cono, which has no official currency, though favors and material goods are
	normally exchanged in place of currency, though the credit bills and cred'chits of the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church.html">Unitarian Church</a> occasionally see use, as they are far easier to obtain then the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-united-counties-of-polla">Pollan</a> equivalents.

<p>
	The army of the People's Republic of Cono is a bunch of under-equipped grunts with powerful families using their political connections to
	place their children and cronies into positions of power. However, the army is not the only source of military power within the People's
	Republic of Cono, as strong matriarchs make a habit of having personal armies that they use to enforce their will, protect their interests
	and serve as a source of prestige.

<p>
	Men in <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#cono">Cono</a> are treated as little more than property, to be traded off as favors to other
	matriarchs. This means that men in <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#cono">Cono</a> can look forward to hard labor, being used as
	breeding stock, or service in either the military or in the private armies of powerful matriarchs.
