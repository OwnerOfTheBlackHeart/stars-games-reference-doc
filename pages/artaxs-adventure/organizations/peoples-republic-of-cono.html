<h1>The People's Republic of Cono</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	The government that runs the continent of <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#cono">Cono</a>, the People's Republic of Cono is a
	matriarchal communist state driven towards internal policies and showy, technological development. The internal policies tend to focus on
	the government retaining power over the people and ensuring that men have no capacity to revolt against the regime, while the
	technological development is often little more than a show of "progress" that, at best, finds its way into the hands of the elite members
	of the <a href="#the-party">Party</a>.
</p>
<p>
	The People's Republic of Cono is corrupt throughout most levels of the government, all the way to <a href="#premier">Premier</a> Tsaryova
	Victorovna. This is most visible in the "economy" of the People's Republic of Cono, which has no official currency, though favors and
	material goods are normally exchanged in place of currency, though the credit bills and cred'chits of the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-unitarian-church">Unitarian Church</a> occasionally see use, as they are far easier to obtain then the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-united-counties-of-polla">Pollan</a> equivalents.
</p>
<p>
	The army of the People's Republic of Cono is a bunch of under-equipped grunts with powerful families using their political connections to
	place their children and cronies into positions of power. However, the army is not the only source of military power within the People's
	Republic of Cono, as strong matriarchs make a habit of having personal armies that they use to enforce their will, protect their interests
	and serve as a source of prestige.
</p>

<h3 id="men">Men in <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#cono">Cono</a></h3>
<p>
	Men in <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#cono">Cono</a> are treated as little more than property, to be traded off as favors to other
	matriarchs. This means that men in <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#cono">Cono</a> can look forward to hard labor, being used as
	breeding stock, or service in either the military or in the private armies of powerful matriarchs.
</p>

<h2 id="social-ranks">Social Ranks in the PRC</h2>
<p>
	While the PRC has a seemingly endless supply of social ranks, titles and job descriptions, those with any level of power or leadership go
	exclusively to women, often to cronies, family or friends of those above them, though buying a rank/title/position is not unheard of.
</p>
<p>
	While there is technically no nobility within the PRC, as it is a communist state, those with enough wealth, familial connections and/or
	political sway form a type of oligarchy. Most attain their influence from being important within the <a href="#the-party">Party</a> or
	from commanding powerful industries, utilizing their ability to trade favors in order to exert control over the PRC, or at least their
	tiny little slice of it.
</p>

<h3 id="premier">Premier</h3>
<p>
	The head of government for the PRC, the Premier is in charge of military and police concerns at the "federal" level, the PRC's foreign
	policy, and the overall direction of the PRC. Often also holding the position of Head of the <a href="#the-party">Party</a> within the
	PRC, the Premier possesses the power to elect/assign nearly any title, rank or position on a whim, with the exception of the
	<a href="#soviet">soviets</a> of the <a href="#council-of-soviets">Council of Soviets</a>.
</p>
<p>
	While the Premier technically doesn't have the authority to make laws, she possesses the power to make decrees, which are treated as law
	until the next meeting of the <a href="#council-of-soviets">Council of Soviets</a>, where the decrees are nearly always made law.
</p>

<h3 id="soviet">Soviet</h3>
<p>
	Elected by and from the "nobility" of the <a href="#the-party">Party</a>, soviets are those who hold seats on the
	<a href="#council-of-soviets">Council of Soviets</a>. The normal day to day powers and responsibilities of a soviet are essentially nill,
	but their positions within the <a href="#the-party">Party</a> and closeness to the <a href="#premier">Premier</a> allow soviets to hold
	considerable power within the PRC.
</p>
<p>
	Soviets are elected by the <a href="#mere">meres</a> of an okrug, a sub-national division roughly equivalent to a province, for a 5 year
	term.
</p>

<h3 id="mere">Mere</h3>
<p>
	The lowest form of "nobility" within the PRC to have power attached to their title, a mere is effectively a mayor, with official power
	over a city, town, or the like. While most of a mere's duties lay within their city, meres are responsible for voting for their local
	<a href="#soviet">soviet</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="commissar-civilian">Commissar</h3>
<p>
	A catch-all rank describing a "noble" put in charge of maintaining order and enforcing the will of a higher "noble," such as the
	<a href="#premier">Premier</a> or a <a href="#mere">mere</a>, commissars bear the authority and power of the "noble" who gave them their
	position, but are at a constant risk of "demotion," usually of the lethal kind, should they fail to meet their "noble's" expectations.
</p>
<p>
	Commissars are as likely to be operating as police as they are representatives of their noble, and are usually what the people of the PRC
	view as the eyes and fists of any given "noble."
</p>
<p>
	All commissars are equally accountable to the <a href="#the-party">Party</a> as they are to their own "noble," with some commissars being
	"elected" by the <a href="#the-party">Party</a>, should they feel the need to exert their power directly.
</p>
<p>Regardless of form, the rank of commissar is the highest rank that the common women of the PRC can hope for.</p>

<h2 id="military-ranks">Military Ranks in the Combined Armies of the Republic</h2>
<p>
	While only a small number of ranks are presented here, the CAR has many minor ranks filling out the space between the ranks presented. The
	ranks called out here are those typically viewed as important by outsiders and civilians.
</p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<p>
	The most commonly shared rank between any two given militaries, the generals of the CAR serve the same role as most others, commanding
	individual armies within the CAR. Depending on the situation, a general may be in charge of a dedicated type of army, such as ground
	forces or air forces, or may command an actively deployed combined arms army. Given that they command armies, most theaters have only one
	general, with the exception of theaters that haven't had their specialized forces combined into a combined arms army.
</p>
<p>
	Outside of times of mass mobilization, generals are either <a href="#soviet">soviets</a> or <a href="#soviet">ex-soviets</a> placed into
	the position by the <a href="#premier">Premier</a> to placate or distract them. During mass mobilization, such as during extended wars on
	the mainland of <a is="ap-nav-link" href="art-mele#cono">Cono</a>, generals are pulled from military officers that have shown excellence
	in commanding large units of troops.
</p>

<h3 id="kovnik">Kovnik</h3>
<p>
	The CAR's equivalent to a lieutenant colonel, a kovnik commands a battalion consisting of 1,000 to 5,000 soldiers (depending on the level
	of mechanization), the smallest organizational group considered capable of independent operations. Depending on the composition of their
	battalion, a kovnik may have command over tanks, helicopters, a small surface fleet (for transport and support), and/or IFVs/APCs.
</p>
<p>
	Kovniks are normally drawn from "nobles" and sycophants of their commanding officers. Those who gained their position through favors
	rarely try to impress and normally command "display" units, while those drawn from a commanding officer's pool of sycophants seek to
	please their commanding officer and gain even further favor, earning them active combat units.
</p>

<h3 id="commissar-military">Commissar</h3>
<p>
	A mix of morale officer, non-commissioned officer, and Party ideals enforcer, commissars form the lowest level of the command structure of
	the CAR. Commissars are assigned a squad or fireteam of male soldiers and are expected to keep them in line, punishing and/or executing
	males that believe their position as a soldier gives them some form of self determination.
</p>
<p>
	In active combat, a commissar's main job is driving their soldiers toward the objective(s) given to them by their commanding officer.
	Commissars do have autonomy in combat, able to change objectives on the fly in the heat of battle, though they are held responsible for
	any consequences of such actions. Because of the consequences of executing autonomy, commissars normally either follow through with an
	order until all their soldiers are dead, then retreat back to friendly lines (which places the blame on their commanding officers), or
	call in a request for a change of plans to their commanding officer(s).
</p>
<p>Regardless of form, the rank of commissar is the highest rank that the common women of the PRC can hope for.</p>

<h2 id="federal-organizations">Federal Organizations Within the People's Republic of Cono</h2>
<h3 id="council-of-soviets">The Council of Soviets</h3>
<p>
	Technically the supreme legislative body within the PRC, the Council of Soviets' main duty is the election, and the removal of, the
	<a href="#premier">Premier</a>. The Council of Soviets has the power to both write laws and veto laws written by the
	<a href="#premier">Premier</a>, though this is typically little more than a formality.
</p>
<p>
	The Council of Soviets meets 4 times a year, at the official change of seasons. During this meeting, which normally lasts 2 weeks, or
	less, the Council reviews all laws made by the <a href="#premier">Premier</a> since the last meeting and whether the current
	<a href="#premier">Premier</a> should be allowed to retain their office or be removed. For the rest of the year, individual
	<a href="#soviet">soviets</a> watch over their elector bodies, pursue personal goals, and/or aid the <a href="#premier">Premier</a>
	in the operation of the PRC.
</p>

<h3 id="the-party">The Communist Peoples' Party</h3>
<p>
	Normally referred to as the Party, the Communist Peoples' Party is the single political party within the PRC, and holds most of the day to
	day power through its control of the "nobility" and strict enforcement of "correct" ideals. As an organization, the Party enforces an
	almost cult-like attitude of, effectively, worshipping the leaders of the Party.
</p>
<p>
	Only women can join the Party, though girls can start making connections within the Party through a dizzying number of Party supported
	youth programs.
</p>

<h3 id="byuro-vneshney-bezopasnosti">Byuro Vneshney Bezopasnosti</h3>
<p>
	The Byuro Vneshney Bezopasnosti, abbreviated BVB, is the main security agency for the PRC. The BVB is tasked with gathering intelligence
	on other nations, performing "disruptive" operations, and quietly enforcing the will of the PRC outside of their borders.
</p>
<p>
	The BVB operates through agents who work alone, or in groups of up to 3, to build up spy rings and execute various operations within the
	borders of other nations.
</p>
