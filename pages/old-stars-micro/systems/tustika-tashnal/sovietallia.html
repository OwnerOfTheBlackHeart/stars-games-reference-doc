	Rarely visited by outsiders, Sovietallia is a true socialist state, with resources and labor distributed to the population by a computer
	system known as StalinNet. However, because of a large amount of automation in almost every industry, citizens work only about 1/10 as
	much as normal otherworlders, devoting much of their time to producing and consuming various forms of digital media.

	A type of animation called "krasivyy risunok" is very popular on Sovietallia and bares many similarities to modern anime, including the
	heavy use of anthromorphs and kemonomimis. The locals of Sovietallia get almost as heated about their favorite forms of anthromorphs and
	kemonomimis as they do about the various sports they play.

	Most otherworlders are not allowed on Sovietallia and are not allowed to interact with the local population. Instead, a "noble" class
	handles interacting with otherworlders, usually buying offworld goods for their own amusement. Sovietallia also has a local chapter of the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="fellowship-of-steel">Fellowship of Steel</a>, which the nobles use as a means to more actively trade with other
	worlds.
