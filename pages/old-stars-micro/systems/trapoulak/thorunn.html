	The planet the party started on, Thorunn is a mostly tropical "resort" planet with a wall of hurricane that spans from pole to pole,
	slowly rotating the planet over the course of 10 years (2.2 miles/3.5 kilometers per day). Most of the population of Thorunn is
	anthromorphs, with the most command "land" races being catfolk, foxfolk, and dogfolk, with wolffolk and other more feral races being
	uncommon, but not unheard of.
</p>
<p>
	Most cities on Thorunn are mobile, so as to avoid the hurricane wall. Depending on the population of the individual city, different
	methods of propulsion are used. Most cities are amphibious, though the largest cities are only able to travel on the oceans.
</p>
<p>
	Thorunn has a thriving tourism industry catered heavily towards offworlders, which serves as its main source of income. Because of the
	roughly 10 year limit on any permanent operation, most materials come from extra-planetary mining operations. Due to offworlder interest
	in anthromorphs for "recreational" purposes, slavery is a large issue on Thorunn.
</p>
<p>
	Due to the types of people that frequent Thorunn, it is often difficult for those who have crashed, or otherwise become trapped on world,
	to find transport off the planet.

<h2 id="beachtopia">Beachtopia</h2>
<p>
	A city that has a permanent population of about 100,000 and a maximum population of 150,000, Beachtopia is an amphibious city that
	normally follows the coasts, disembarking for 4 to 6 months at a time. When the population gets too high, Beachtopia will drive further
	from the hurricane wall than it normally travels to give time for it to create a new city/town to take the excess population.

<h2 id="kingston">Kingston</h2>
<p>
	The capital city of Thorunn, as well as its largest city, Kingston is only able to travel along the oceans due to its massive size.
	Kingston can handle up to 10,000,000 people, though the city normally maintains a population between 5 to 8 million.
</p>

<h2 id="new-kingston">New Kingston</h2>
<p>
	The second largest city on Thorunn, New Kingston is jokingly referred to as the "We Couldn't Get to Kingston" city. It has a max
	population of 5,000,000 and, much like its namesake, is only able to travel the oceans. However, New Kingston does have the ability to
	travel through canals.
</p>

<h2 id="kingston-2">Kingston II</h2>
<p>
	The newest "major" city on Thorunn, Kingston II is an ocean going city with a maximum population of 8,000,000 people, though its relative
	newness means that the city is understaffed and lacks any major draw to offworlders. The people of Kingston II have a rivalry with New
	Kingston, though New Kingston doesn't reciprocate the rivalry.
