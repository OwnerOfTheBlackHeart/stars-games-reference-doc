<h1>Sum's Contacts</h1>
<h2>Nikkya Calder</h2>
<p>
	Nikkya is a yandere ex-girlfriend of Sum who has yet to let go. She works in
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#beachtopia">Beachtopia's</a> "farms" as a edaphologist, though she is also commonly does soil analysis
	for the various farming groups when <a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#beachtopia">Beachtopia's</a>
	disembarks. Nikkya also occasionally dips into smuggling and drug production.
</p>
<p>
	Nikkya is a 5' 8" tall, female fox-girl with E (DD) cup titties, red fur with golden fur on her chest and stomach, an abnormally long
	tail, and striking golden eyes. When working, Nikkya will wear either a heavily pocketed lab coat with waterproof hiking boots or a short
	skirt and a crop top with a sturdy apron (which also has lots of pockets). When not working, Nikkya will wear a skirt or pair of shorts
	with light, breathable semi-transparent t-shirts, though on rare occasions she'll replace the t-shirt with a poncho.
</p>

<h2>Tremelle Polson</h2>
<p>
	Tremelle is the owner of Polson Housing and Transportation (PHT), which builds embarkable homes and 1 to 4 seat all terrain vehicles. Due
	to the popularity of PHT's products, and frequent contracting during new city construction, Tremelle is quite wealthy for a resident of
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#beachtopia">Beachtopia</a>. Tremelle doesn't delve much into crime, though she owns the Ripcord and Rum,
	a bar that is popular with fixers and has Tremelle's beloved fighting pit.
</p>
<p>
	Tremelle is a 5' 3" tall, pudgy otter girl with B cup titties, well cared for chocolate brown fur and brown eyes. Tremelle typically wears
	layers of colored silks and other thin, breathable materials over a well made black dress and plentiful jewelry. While she dresses the way
	she dresses to look wealthy, Tremelle puts in the time to make sure that all her garments and jewelry go together.
</p>
<p>
	As an expression of wealth, Tremelle keeps a rabbit girl (Jasmine East) and a bat girl (Raca McCullock) with her at all times. When at the
	Ripcord and Rum, Tremelle will sit on a throne overlooking the fighting pit (and whole room) with Jasmine and Raca on either side, leaning
	up against the padded sides of the throne.
