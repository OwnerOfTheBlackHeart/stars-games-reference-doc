<p>The Sovetskiy Global’nyy Soyuz, the global state of Sovietallia, has long venerated the founder of Communism, Karl Marx.</p>
<p>
	Although the state and its people are officially atheistic, the ideas of the faiths of Buddhism and Eastern Orthodox Christianity were
	brought with the world's original colonists, and over time these beliefs not only blended but further became a part of the state ideology,
	to the point where the two were inseparable.
</p>
<p>
	The people of Sovietallia believe that after death, one will reincarnate into this world again. Although new souls are created, death is
	never a permanent measure, and for all eternity the people will be reborn and work together in the endless struggle for equality and
	freedom. Despite this, however, transcending this cycle of reincarnation is possible.
</p>
<p>
	Marx, to the people of Sovietallia, is a “Prosvetlennyy”, an enlightened one. He was the first to put forth the ideas of Communism, and he
	was in fact the latest incarnation of the holy Buddha as well as a reincarnation of Jesus Christ. As he was the latest and most important
	of these incarnations, the worship of these figures fell to the wayside in favor of Marx and those who followed him.
</p>
<p>
	Although largely drawing from Communist ideology and Buddhism, structurally Sovietallian Marxism most resembles the Eastern Orthodox
	Church. There is no official head of Marxism. Instead, faith separates the world into 200 Komitet, which function as councils for the
	lower churches. These Komitet are each further subdivided into 16 Komissariats each, which function as regional church bodies and are each
	headed by a Komissar. Below the Komissar are the leaders of the churches themselves, who are called Professors.
</p>
<p>
	The 200 Komitet, likewise, elect one individual to represent them in the Kadry, the council which officially leads all Komitet. The
	individuals elected to this office are known as “Dorogoy Lider”, Dear Leader(s).
</p>
<p>
	Despite having an official body overseeing them, the various Komitet are largely independent of one another, and the primary purpose of it
	is largely to hand done missives from StalinNet and vote on important matters such as the canonization of new Totktoischet.
</p>
<p>
	Other important leaders of Soviet history have been elevated as “Totktoischet”, one(s) who seek. These figures are venerated and prayed to
	for guidance just as Marx is, being viewed as somewhere between Buddhist Bodhisattvas and Christian Saints. The most important ones are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Vladimir Lenin the Vechno Zhiv, ‘forever alive’ (commonly associated with knowledge, healing, and rebirth)</li>
	<li>Joseph Stalin (commonly associated with strength and agriculture)</li>
	<li>Nikita Khrushchev (commonly associated with science and the arts)</li>
	<li>Leonid Brezhnev (commonly associated with construction, progress, and children)</li>
</ul>

		In the capital of Sovietallia, Novaya Moskva, is a place known as <b>The Red Square</b>. The Red Square is next to the Kremlin, where
		the central processing node of StalinNet is, and is home to the Cathedral of the Vechno Zhiv. Appearing as a combination of a giant
		Russian orthodox church combined with a red pyramid, this is where the Sovietallian Mausoleum of Lenin is, which supposedly holds the
		still un-corrupted hand of Vladimir Lenin. This hand is regularly anointed with olive oil, which is then used in rituals by the
		Professors of the Cathedral. It is said to have healing properties.
