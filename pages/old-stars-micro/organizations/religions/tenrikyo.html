<p>
	Tenrikyo is the main religion of <a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn">Thorunn</a> and its inhabitants. Focusing around several deities of
	fertility, nature, weather, nomadism, etc., Tenrikyo does very little to restrict how someone lives their daily life, though it has a
	strong forming healthy communities and preserving resources. Tenrikyo was created by the prophet Lamar Kildar, who expanded on the prior
	Akhbari faith with the introduction of 3 new books describing the god <a href="#xumyin">Xumyin</a>, his travels, and how important a
	strong community is to the physical, spiritual and divine worlds.
</p>
<p>
	The churches of Tenrikyo are guided by the community itself, with Druids, Witches, Shamans and the like being responsible for performing
	religious services to their flocks, as well as managing the monthly meetings of the flocks for religious and church matters. Tenrikyo also
	encourages the creation of groups of templars, known as Guardians, who serve to protect church property when disembarked, protect the
	flock from threats beyond the scope of city police forces, and to generally aid the community where they can.
</p>
<p>
	Because of Tenrikyo's focus on community and the normal duties of the Guardians, Guardians often have further rights and responsibilities
	granted to them by their cities'. Some may serve to watch over dangerous individuals, act as SWAT units, or serve as special police units,
	such as anti-drug or anti-slavery units, though they always serve the people rather than the government.

<h3 id="xumyin">Xumyin</h3>
<p>
	The newest of the gods of Tenrikyo, Xumyin is the father god of the tanuki and the god of peaches, revelry, relaxation and emotional
	healing. Xumyin is portrayed as a wandering hero who is as liable to save the day with his psionic powers, clever wit, jovial personality,
	or a mix of the three.
</p>
<p>
	Tanuki responses to Lamar Kildar's claims of Xumyin are mixed, with some claiming him little more than appeasement, while others claim
	that Xumyin is drawn from tanuki theology.
</p>

<h3 id="niunan">Niunan (Niunyan)</h3>
<p>
	One of the elder three of the Tenrikyo faith, Niunan is the mother god of the catfolk and god of pranks, playfulness, lightning and
	physical energy. The stories of Niunan have her solving problems with her agility, speed and cleverness, her ability to quickly make
	short-term plans, and her willingness to bring in <a href="#adopi">Adopi</a> and <a href="#babalu">Babalu</a>. Niunan is also said to be
	in a relationship with <a href="#babalu">Babalu</a>.
</p>
<p>
	One of the most popular stories of Niunan is of a prank war between her and <a href="#adopi">Adopi</a>, though the most referenced part of
	the story is that thunderstorms are caused whenever Niunan and <a href="#babalu">Babalu</a> dance together.
</p>

<h3 id="adopi">Adopi</h3>
<p>
	One of the elder three of the Tenrikyo faith, Adopi is the god of the foxfolk and god of careful actions, psionics, trickery, fire,
	self-sufficiency and the calm (both physical and mental calm). Adopi's stories have them solving their problems with carefully thought
	out, long-term plans, powerful psionics, and cleverly chosen words. Adopi has the ability to change their sex at will and possesses 12
	tails, though any particular meaning to the presence of multiple tails, or the number of tails, has been lost.
</p>
<p>
	Of the elder three, Adopi is the least likely to ask for aid, even when they need it. While Adopi succeeds on there own in most of there
	stories, a common lesson is that there unwillingness to ask for help causes them greater struggles. In the stories where Adopi can't
	succeed on their own, they normally shapeshift into the form of a mortal anthromorph and recruit mortal anthromorphs to aid them, only
	revealing that they have helped a god when they are rewarded with great boons for their services.
</p>
<p>A common way to refer to Adopi is as "The ember that waits beneath the dirt to set the jungle ablaze."</p>

<h3 id="babalu">Babalu</h3>
<p>
	One of the elder three of the Tenrikyo faith, Babalu is the father god of the dogfolk and the god of community, cooperation, friendship,
	the wind and the rain, and physical healing. The stories of Babalu have him solving problems with his physical endurance and by calling in
	help from both gods and mortals. Babalu is said to be in a relationship with <a href="#niunan">Niunan</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Of the elder three, Babalu is typically portrayed as the mediator and heart of the group, as well as the bruiser when conflict arises. One
	of the most popular stories of Babalu has him defeating an alliance of rebellious gods by recruiting mortals to defeat each of the rebel
	gods, showing them that if they can be felled by mortals, they stand no chance against Babalu. In the end, Babalu blesses the mortals that
	aided him by dancing with
	<a href="#niunan">Niunan</a>, creating a thunderstorm which clears a path for the mortals to get there boats through a forest with ease.
