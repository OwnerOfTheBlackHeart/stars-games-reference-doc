<h1>The Fellowship of Steel</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
	The Fellowship of Steel is an organization that seeks and hoards technology for the purpose of preventing the rise of a second "Failed
	Mandate". The Fellowship is a militaristic organization that generally tries to avoid problems that can’t be solved with soldiers. Some
	branches may be opportunistic, altruistic, highly aggressive, or even stealthy, but all are fairly xenophobic and don’t like accepting new
	members unless they prove useful or the chapter is in desperate need of manpower.
</p>
<p>
	In terms of technology, the Fellowship of Steel will use whatever weapons and armor systems that they can get their hands on, with a focus
	on mechs, especially suit mechs. In order to make up for their small size, the Fellowship of Steel uses advanced combat training, mechs,
	and expert systems.
</p>
<p>
	The Fellowship of Steel was once a splinter organization of the Perimeter Agency, however the Fellowship of Steel rarely gets involved
	with maltech and does not actively hunt it.
</p>

<h2 id="primary-objective">Primary Objective</h2>
<p>
	The Fellowship of Steel seeks to prevent the rise of a second Terran Mandate, or similar organization, as they view that if such an
	organization is achieved, it will follow in the footsteps of the original Terran Mandate and devolve into dystopia. The Fellowship also
	tends to take issue with those who use advanced technology to achieve tyrannical control, though they have no issue with tyranny itself.
</p>

<h2 id="greatest-flaw">Greatest Flaw</h2>
<p>
	The Fellowship of Steel routinely runs into 2 major issues: A lack of manpower and corruption. The lack of manpower is a result of their
	general xenophobia, as most chapters won't accept anyone that they can't confirm wasn't a member of another chapter. Due to there
	generally advanced and expensive technology, as well as the high amount of trust placed on members within the Fellowship, corruption is a
	common problem among the Fellowship, with some members choosing to pursue their own gain over the objectives of the Fellowship.
</p>

<h2 id="enemies-and-allies">Enemies and Allies</h2>
<p>
	The Fellowship of Steel has few allies, but many enemies. Because of the lengths that the Fellowship is willing to take to get new
	technologies, they often find themselves at odds with organizations that have advanced technology, but don't like to share it. Only rarely
	does the Fellowship ever have an ally, though it is usually with local governments that supply and fund the Fellowship in exchange for any
	number of services that the soldiers of the Fellowship can supply.
</p>

<h2 id="hierarchy">Hierarchy</h2>
<h3 id="hierarchy-general">General</h3>
<h4 id="seeker">Seeker</h4>
<p>
	A Seeker is a Fellowship member who has experienced a little bit of all of the 3 branches of the Fellowship, but has yet to be accepted as
	a member of any of the branches. Seekers are typically 3rd year members, or around 16 years old if born into the Fellowship, and work to
	convince members of the branch they wish to join to stand for them.
</p>

<h4 id="initiate">Initiate</h4>
<p>
	An Initiate is a Fellowship member who has spent at least 1 year within the Fellowship and is considered to be competent enough with the
	ways of the Fellowship to perform basic duties within any of the branches. Members born into the Fellowship typically earn their Initiate
	rank at 14 years old. A Recruit, whether recruited or born in, must pass a series of simple tests to earn the rank of Initiate.
</p>

<h4 id="recruit">Recruit</h4>
<p>
	A training rank within the Fellowship, Recruits rarely perform any meaningful duties unless heavily monitored, instead doing grunt work
	when not in classes. The rank of Recruit is given to any recruit into the Fellowship, either on the day of their birth or the day they
	officially join the Fellowship.
</p>

<h3 id="governance">Governance</h3>
<h4 id="grand-elder">Grand Elder</h4>
<p>
	The Grand Elder is the highest authority within the Fellowship of Steel. Due to the disconnection from the rest of the sector, the
	Fellowship of Steel on Scrapgasm Prime doesn’t know anything more than basic orders about the current Great Elder.
</p>

<h4 id="high-elder">High Elder</h4>
<p>
	A High Elder is the person in charge of Fellowship operations over a single planet and its man-made satellites. If a planet has only a
	single chapter of the Fellowship of Steel, then they usually don’t have a High Elder.
</p>

<h4 id="elder">Elder</h4>
<p>
	An Elder within the Fellowship of Steel is in charge of a single chapter of the Fellowship. They don’t normally handle day to day
	operations, but they make the most important decisions and determine the major objectives, and their relative importance, of a given
	chapter.
</p>

<h4 id="high-father-mother">High Father/Mother</h4>
<p>
	The High Father/Mother is in charge of the day to day operations of a Fellowship chapter and serves as the go between for the other
	branches and the Elder. In large chapters, there may be multiple High Fathers/Mothers in charge of specific divisions, an independent
	collection of the 3 branches which is assigned its own objectives, of said chapter.
</p>

<h4 id="father-mother">Father/Mother</h4>
<p>
	A Father/Mother of the Fellowship is typically in charge of either 1 of the 3 branches or those within training ranks (Seeker, Initiate,
	and Recruit). Most chapters have 4 Fathers/Mothers, but those that are large enough to split into divisions have 4 Fathers/Mothers per
	division.
</p>

<h3 id="technical">Technical</h3>
<h4 id="overseer">Overseer</h4>
<p>
	The Overseer is the head of the Technical Branch and works to compliment the Father/Mother of the Technical Branch. While the
	Father/Mother of the Technical Branch works to guide the branch in the directions they were given, the Overseer of the Technical Branch
	works to keep track of the nitty-gritty details, such as what resources are being given to which projects, how many personnel a project
	may have, how much of the branch is devoted to processing new materials, etc.
</p>

<h4 id="high-engineer">High Engineer</h4>
<p>
	High Engineers serve as the leads of subsections of the Technical Branch. For example, a High Engineer may be in charge of the research
	projects while another is in charge of handling incoming materials. While the Overseer allocates resources to different projects, High
	Engineers provide assignments to projects and guidance where they can. Smaller chapters may not have a High Engineer and may have the
	Overseer and Engineers share portions of the High Engineers’ duties.
</p>

<h4 id="engineer">Engineer</h4>
<p>
	A member of the Technical Branch determined to be competent enough to lead individual projects. Depending on the age and size of a
	chapter, many Engineers may end up being treated as more experienced Scribes. Compared to a Specialist, Engineers tend to have broad
	experiences in their given roles and may serve as mentors or information hubs even when not leading projects.
</p>

<h4 id="scribe">Scribe</h4>
<p>
	A Scribe is a member of the Technical Branch who has become skilled enough in a narrow field to be given a level of independence. Usually
	Scribe will work in groups with differing fields and an Engineer, or two.
</p>

<h4 id="maintainer">Maintainer</h4>
<p>
	Maintainers are the newly accepted members of the Technical Branch. Maintainers are usually given basic tasks by Scribes or Engineers,
	such as recording sensor information, sifting through logs, or cleaning a specific machine. Maintainers are expected to be able to perform
	tasks that Initiates would, except without supervision. However, Maintainers are also occasionally given more complex tasks, but are
	usually supervised when doing so.
</p>

<h3 id="military">Military</h3>
<h4 id="sentinel-commander">Sentinel Commander</h4>
<p>
	Sentinel Commander is the rarest rank within the Fellowship, serving as the leader for a Sentinel team (usually about the size of a
	fireteam). Sentinel teams are a form of special forces team that serves directly under an Elder, or higher, and is made up of only the
	most trusted members of the military branch, the Sentinels, and is usually only formed when necessity dictates that they must be.
</p>

<h4 id="sentinel">Sentinel</h4>
<p>
	A Sentinel is a member of the Military Branch who normally acts outside of the Military Branch, serving directly under an Elder, or
	higher. Sentinels are given extreme freedom to complete the tasks given to them by their Elder, and as such are drawn from only the most
	trusted and skilled members of a chapter. Sentinels are also trained, and expected, to operate independently from and far away from their
	chapter.
</p>

<h4 id="paladin-valkyrie-general">Paladin/Valkyrie General</h4>
<p>
	The Paladin/Valkyrie General is the head of the Military Branch and serves as the tactical counterpart to the Father/Mother in charge of
	the Military Branch. While the Father/Mother of the Military Branch works to guide the branch in the directions they were given, the
	Paladin/Valkyrie General is in charge of handling the high level tactics, such as which battle groups are in charge of which operations or
	defending which positions. The Paladin/Valkyrie General is also in charge of determining how the battle groups of their chapter or
	division are organized.
</p>

<h4 id="paladin-valkyrie-commander">Paladin/Valkyrie Commander</h4>
<p>
	A Paladin/Valkyrie Commander is in charge of a single battle group. They handle setting up the patrols and formations of the battle group,
	the distribution of weaponry and armor with the battle group and which tools and personnel are deployed to an operation.
</p>

<h4 id="paladin-valkyrie">Paladin/Valkyrie</h4>
<p>
	A Paladin/Valkyrie is a member of the military branch that has been deemed worthy of a suit mech. When this determination is made, the new
	Paladin/Valkyrie undergoes a procedure where their arms and legs are replaced with detachable cybernetic prosthetics, whose mounting
	points allow them smoother control of the suit mechs. Outside of their use as heavy troopers and shock troopers, Paladins/Valkyries have
	duties similar to the Knight Commander.
</p>

<h4 id="knight-commander">Knight Commander</h4>
<p>
	A Knight Commander is in charge of leading single operations, typically fighting alongside their soldiers. Knight Commanders are veteran
	members of the Military Branch and serve as a mix between an officer and an NCO.
</p>

<h4 id="knight">Knight</h4>
<p>
	A Knight is an experienced member of the Military Branch and may serve as members of specialized fireteams or as the leader of a fireteam.
	Knights serving in the ladder role are similar to NCOs.
</p>

<h4 id="soldier">Soldier</h4>
<p>
	A Soldier is the basic soldier of the Fellowship. Their duties outside of combat include cleaning and maintaining weaponry and armor as
	well as serving as security and police within the Fellowship.
</p>
