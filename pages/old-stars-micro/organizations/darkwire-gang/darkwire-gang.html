<h1>The Darkwire Gang</h1>
<p>
	The Darkwire Gang is a criminal organization based out of a <a href="#old-burt">mobile "cargo hamlet"</a> that normally stays near
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#beachtopia">Beachtopia</a>, though they usually keep enough distance to avoid direct retaliation. The
	primary source of income for the Darkwire Gang is smuggling military grade equipment, ranging from mag weapons to robots and powered
	armor, though the Darkwire Gang will raid crashed freighters and supply caravans when available (they are careful when choosing to attack
	caravans, so as to avoid drawing too much heat). Some members of the Darkwire Gang sell drugs on the side when credits become tight.
</p>
<p>
	Members of the Darkwire Gang are identified by their distinctive black cybernetic left arms, which they can hide under a pseudo-skin when
	they need to enter a city. Members of the Darkwire Gang tend to be well armed and, when they put it on, well armored, though they have
	fewer numbers than in-city gangs.
</p>
<p>
	A common past time of the Darkwire Gang is robot fights, which are held in pits and usually limited to melee armed robots. Wealthier
	members of the Darkwire Gang own proper military combat robots, which they may bring on raids where they need extra manpower.

<h3 id="old-burt">Old Burt</h3>
<p>
	The mobile "cargo hamlet" that the Darkwire Gang operates from, Old Burt is a city support vessel from before the reintroduction of the
	fusion reactor that has been modernized and turned into a mobile fortress. Most of the old maintenance facilities within Old Burt have
	been restored or upgraded, though full fabrication ability is still minimal, while the space saved by upgrade the motors and the fission
	reactor to a fusion reactor has been converted the housing or storage.
</p>
<p>
	The outside of Old Burt looks like a fortress, with armored plating, towers, anti-aircraft guns and gunslits, all carefully chosen to be
	too much of a threat for police forces to attack while not enough of one to draw the attention of proper military forces. The top deck of
	Old Burt holds the bars and recreation areas, the mid-decks hold the housing and robot storage, and the lower decks hold manufacturing,
	maintenance and the vehicle garages.
</p>
<p>
	Old Burt can support 300 people maximum, while the Darkwire Gang typically have 150 to 200 people while embarked and 75 to 100 while
	disembarked.
</p>

<h3 id="ethanol-cylinder">The Ethanol Cylinder</h3>
<p>
	The biggest bar on <a href="#old-burt">Old Burt</a>, the Ethanol Cylinder is a reinforced metal brick with a sign depicting a 2 cylinder
	engine being filled by a bottle of beer. The inside of the bar features a large open space in the center (used for fighting as much as
	dancing and karaoke), tables and stalls lining the center area, a raised "VIP" area in the back, opposite the bar itself, which takes up
	its entire wall. There are two other doors beside the entrance, one which leads to rooms that can be rented by the hour with the swipe of
	a cred chip and one which leads down one deck, to <a href="#darius-gayle">Darius Gayle's</a> private arena.
</p>
<p>
	Due to the proximity to <a href="#darius-gayle">Darius</a>, most other important members of the Darkwire Gang spend at least some part of
	their day at the Ethanol Cylinder.
</p>

<h3 id="barons-armory">The Baron's Armory</h3>
<p>
	A larger, warehouse like building made from titanium-aluminum alloys with a sign depicting a Fallout style laser rifle shooting a guy in a
	bullet vest, The Baron's Armory is the largest public weapons and armor store on <a href="#old-burt">Old Burt</a>. The front of The
	Baron's Armory is a small shop with a small selection of weapons in displays and a 3 lane firing range off to the left of the main
	counter. Behind the counter is a secured door that leads into the warehouse. Much of the selection of The Baron's Armory is only available
	by request.
</p>
<p>The Baron's Armory is owned by <a href="#baron-nunes">Baron Nunes</a>.</p>
