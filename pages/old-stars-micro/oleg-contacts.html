<h1>Oleg's Contacts</h1>
<h2 id="yuri">Engineer Yuri</h2>
<p>
	An engineer from the Fellowship of Steel chapter on <a is="ap-nav-link" href="sovietallia">Sovietallia</a>, Yuri is one of the few beacons
	of familiarity to Oleg. Yuri primarily operates out of Not Kitten Manufacturing, a custom order manufacturing shot that builds everything
	from parts for home appliances to small order military equipment.
</p>
<p>
	Yuri is a 6' 3" human male with a, nearly blonde, light brown high and tight with slightly tanned skin and hazel eyes. He usually wears
	his brown and green engineer's jumpsuit, laden down with tools and parts. When caught outside of Not Kitten Manufacturing, Yuri may wear a
	pair of cargo shorts with a light, hawaiian shirt that is kept mostly buttoned and tucked in.
</p>

<h3 id="not-kitten">Not Kitten Manufacturing</h3>
<p>
	Named after a pun from the old <a is="ap-nav-link" href="sovietallia">Sovietallian</a> game Monster Slayer, this shop looks like a normal
	small machine shop from the outside, with a simple sign, blue painted metal walls, and unassuming glass entry doors, inside the actual
	manufacturing area of Not Kitten Manufacturing is filled with highly advanced manufacturing equipment and even an overhead crane. Not
	Kitten Manufacturing doesn't look large from the front, though the building itself is quite deep.

<h2 id="freya-gray">Freya Gray</h2>
<p>
	While considered a great bane by Oleg, Freya likes to fancy herself as a friend of Oleg, despite how much Oleg mistreats her. Though, one
	might think that she does so <b>BECAUSE</b> Oleg resists her. Unfortunately for Oleg, Freya always seems to have something for Oleg to do,
	as well as the money to compensate Oleg for their services.
</p>
<p>
	Freya is a 5' 5", calico patterned female catfolk with E (DD) cup titties, short, untufted ears, and heterochromatic eyes, with the left
	eye being yellow and amber and the right eye being blue/orange dichroic. Freya normally wears little more than a bikini (several different
	sets) with thigh high boots, though she always has at least a mag pistol and a monoblade xiphos on her person.
</p>
<p>
	Freya has connections with several groups within <a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#beachtopia">Beachtopia</a>, both legal and illegal,
	usually serving as an info broker and a fence.
