	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="thresh-contacts#tauni-ripley">Staff Sergeant Tauni Ripley</a> is concerned because the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#beachtopia">Beachtopia</a> Rapid Combat Force (RCF) is having trouble getting medical supplies. After
	some research, <a is="ap-nav-link" href="thresh-contacts#tauni-ripley">Tauni</a>
	has identified several alternative medicines of interest, and would like the party to acquire enough to tide the RCF over until they can
	deal with their medicine issues.

		<a is="ap-nav-link" href="thresh-contacts#tauni-ripley">Tauni</a> needs the following materials to make her medicines:
		<ul>
			<li>4 liters of <a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#duanys-dragon">duany's dragon</a> poison.</li>
			<li>1 liter of <a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#old-mernian-burrower">old mernian burrower</a> blood.</li>
			<li>5 bundles of <a href="#zeazeac">zeazeac</a> darts.</li>
		</ul>
		<a is="ap-nav-link" href="thresh-contacts#tauni-ripley">Tauni</a> wants the different items because:
		<ul>
			<li><a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#duanys-dragon">Duany's dragon</a> poison is useful as a local anesthetic.</li>
			<li>
				<a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#old-mernian-burrower">Old mernian burrower</a> blood can be mixed with common food items to make

	The zeazeac is a meter tall, gangly looking quadrupedal mammal with mottled brown, green and yellow fur, a long, narrow muzzle, tall, wide
	ears that lay flat along its neck when threatened and bright orange, forward facing eyes. Inside the mouth of the zeazeac is a small organ
	that allows the zeazeac to release a small, barbed dart made of bone into its mouth, which the zeazeac launches using its tongue and a
	hard section of the roof of its mouth. On the backs of the legs of the zeazeac is a climbing claw that allows the zeazeac to have
	surprisingly nimble arboreal movement.
</p>
<p>
	Zeazeacs move in packs of 4 to 8, though on rare occasions groups as small as mating pairs may travel about or packs as large as 19 can
	form. Most of the time, zeazeacs only descend from the trees to move about or feast on freshly killed prey. Despite their prevalence among
	the jungles surrounding Beachtopia, zeazeacs are rarely a problem for humans and anthromorphs, as the zeazeacs don't normally attack tall
	prey.
