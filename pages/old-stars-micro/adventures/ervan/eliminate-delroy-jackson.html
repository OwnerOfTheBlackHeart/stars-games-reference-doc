		The party begins investigating locations:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Naked Neon Night Club</b>
				<ul>
					<ap-auth-container permissions="old-stars-micro-full">

							<a href="https://x00ml23bacv241zkk3hjy0sk-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/E11even-Nightclub-Table-Map.jpg">
								Basic Layout
							</a>
						</li>
					</ap-auth-container>
					<li>
						The Naked Neon Night Club is a wide, squat building with painted pink metal siding and what appears to be an office building on
						the upper floor. The front has a small, red carpet with matching rope barriers in front of a pair of double doors, which have 2
						bouncers when the night club is open. The sign is a stylized neon tube removing a skirt and bra.
					</li>
					<li>
						The inside of the NNNC is a typical night club, with a gravitically levitated stage, 2 balcony/loft floors with arena style VIP
						lounges and an active crowd.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="#malik-mendes">Malik Mende</a> and <a href="#takira-peate">Takira Peate</a> regularly spend time at the Naked Neon
						Night Club.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>North 24th Street Safe House</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A standard, 2 story wooden city home with a relatively new coat of blue paint, this safe house doesn't stand out at all from
						it's neighbors. Inside the house, however, looks like the result of a wild frat party, with broken and turned over furniture,
						drug paraphernalia, beer bottles, and food scraps scattered all over the 5 room home.
					</li>
					<li>A group of 3 <a href="#common-guard">gangers</a> (common guard) are currently staying at the safe house.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Taye Drive Safe House</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						From the outside, the Taye Drive safe house looks like a standard small warehouse, with unpainted metal and catwalk windows that
						could use a little maintenance. The inside, however, includes a 3 car garage, kitchen, bathrooms, multiple bedrooms, a living
						room and a "commons" room, all fairly nice.
					</li>
					<li>
						This is the safe house that <a href="#delroy-jackson">Delroy</a> is staying at. With him are 2
						<a href="#common-guard">gangers</a> (common guard).
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Teja Uton Housing Complex Safe House</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The Teja Uton Housing Complex safe house is a "house" within the Teja Uton Housing Complex, a large, cheap looking wooden
						building with peeling green paint and 3 stories of "apartments." Each story has 20 "apartments," with each apartment consisting
						of a hotel style bedroom and bathroom, and a small kitchen.
					</li>
					<li>A group of 2 <a href="#common-guard">gangers</a> (common guard) are currently staying at the safe house.</li>
				</ul>

	A hit man for the Gravestones, Delroy is a 5' 4" male catfolk with a flat gray coat. He is normally dressed in a lightweight, green
	peplos, though he frequently changes attire when on the hunt, so as to get close to his enemies. Delroy never goes anywhere without his
	armored undersuit.

	The right hand of <a href="#takira-peate">Takira</a> and effectively second in command of the Gravestones, Malik is a 5' 2" male sharkfolk
	with sand colored skin with red horizontal stripes and an abnormally vicious mouth, even for a sharkfolk. Malik normally wears an armored
	evaporative cooling trench coat, using the various water pouches to hide weapons and a dizzying array of recreational drugs, and a pair of
	basketball shorts with belt loops and pockets sewn on, with a leather belt holding the shorts up.

<p>
	The leader of the Gravestones, Takira is a 5' 3" female catfolk with an orange and cream tuxedo pattern, D cup titties, and golden eyes.
	She normally wears a sports bra with a kilt, storing her mag pistol in the kilt pocket. Takira rarely hides her monoblade, which looks
	like a typical hunting knife that she keeps in a sheath attached to her bra, under her left armpit.
</p>
<p>
	Despite not wearing any armor, Takira has mild psionic abilities that give her an effect similar to wearing a set of woven body armor.
