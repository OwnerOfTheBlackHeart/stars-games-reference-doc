	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="ine-contacts#tyreck-mais">Shaman Tyreck Mais</a> knows of a small mine that some locals have been looking to
	recover and use to get some quick and cheap metals, however, several
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#old-mernian-burrower">old mernian burrowers</a> have taken up residence in the caves and are preventing
	the short term mining operation from starting. He's willing to offer 500 credits to have the
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#old-mernian-burrower">burrowers</a>
	cleared out.

		The party goes to the mine:

			<li>If the party walks, it takes 4 hours.</li>
			<li>If the party rents a ground or hover car, it takes 30 minutes.</li>

		The party delves the abandoned mine. Four main chambers and a hallway remain usable, while the rest are flooded:
		<ol>
			<li>
				The entry hallway. Wide enough for a small truck to drive through and connecting the four usable chambers. Holds 2
				<a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#old-mernian-burrower">burrowers</a> waiting in ambush.
			</li>
			<li>
				First room on the left. A larger, square room. Damaged and turned over furniture suggests a prior use as rest area. 5

			<li>
				First room on the right. Has a door large enough to fit a small truck through. Smashed boxes and a turned over desk suggest an
				office with a storage area. 3 <a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#old-mernian-burrower">burrowers</a> wait in ambush.

			<li>
				Second room on the left. Some ruined man-portable mining equipment hints at this room being more exploratory in nature. 4
				<a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#old-mernian-burrower">burrowers</a> lie in ambush.
			</li>
			<li>
				Third room on the left. Larger, ruined mining equipment is setup in this room, suggesting that it used to be near a vein. 3
