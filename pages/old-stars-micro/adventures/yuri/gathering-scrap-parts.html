<h1>Gathering Scrap Parts</h1>
<ul class="link-list">
	<li><b>Location:</b> <a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#beachtopia">Beachtopia</a></li>
	<li><b>Expected Levels:</b> 2-3</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="oleg-contacts#yuri">Engineer Yuri</a> has discovered an abandoned factory full of damaged and waterlogged
	machines a ways away from <a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#beachtopia">Beachtopia</a>.
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="oleg-contacts#yuri">Yuri</a> wants the machines within the factory so that he can repair/refurbish them.
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="oleg-contacts#yuri">Yuri</a> will offer a combat field uniform, a laser rifle and a bundle of 6 A cells for this
	job.
</p>
<p>
	Due to the size of the machines involved, <a is="ap-nav-link" href="oleg-contacts#yuri">Yuri</a> will offer the party the use of 2 of his
	delivery trucks and 4 workers trained in operating the removal equipment.
</p>

	<li>
		Oleg is given the adventure by <a is="ap-nav-link" href="oleg-contacts#yuri">Yuri</a>. If Oleg asks,
		<a is="ap-nav-link" href="oleg-contacts#yuri">Yuri</a> will say that he's interested in either selling the machines/parts once
		refurbished, or keeping them as spare parts for his own shop.
	</li>
	<li>
		The party travels to the abandoned factory (navigation skill check):
		<ul>
			<li>If the check is 10, or higher, then the party arrives at the factory after 2 hours of travel.</li>
			<li>If the check is 8, or higher, then the party arrives at the factory after 3 hours of travel.</li>
			<li>If the check is 6, or higher, then the party arrives at the factory after 5 hours of travel.</li>
			<li>If the check is 5, or lower, then the party wastes an hour and must roll again.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		The party arrives at the abandoned factory:
		<ul>
			<li>
				From the outside, the factory looks like a large, metal dome built at the center of 6 trees. The dome looks sound, though the roof
				has multiple holes in it. The main entrance to the factory has "Facility 11" written above it in fading letters as well as a
				half-opened blast door. An appropriate skill check will reveal that the location of the factory was chosen so as to use the trees
				surrounding it as protection from the hurricane wall.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 1:</b> The entryway to Facility 11 has only dim lighting and several dead animals with burn marks and large nails sticking
				out of them. 2 <a href="#decaying-maintenance-bot">decaying maintenance bots</a> sit at the end of the hallway.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 2:</b> A small maintenance closet containing various scrapped cleaning machines and empty containers that should hold
				cleaning chemicals.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 3:</b> A small maintenance closet containing a waterlogged post-tech toolkit and a small robot/powered armor maintenance
				stand.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 4:</b> A small factory floor filled with machines large and small, though only a few are in workable condition. The rest are
				either waterlogged or have been scavenged for parts. 4 <a href="#decaying-maintenance-bot">decaying maintenance bots</a> and a
				<a href="#refurbished-maintenance-bot">refurbished maintenance bot</a> wait in this room.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 5:</b> A large storage/warehouse area containing water-damaged pallets and empty metal crates. Some of the crates have been
				disassembled.
			</li>
			<li><b>Room 6:</b> A small hallway guarded by 1 <a href="#refurbished-maintenance-bot">refurbished maintenance bot</a>.</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 7:</b> A stairway leading to a living area. In the living area is a half-ton of rotting foodstuffs, incomplete sets of
				furniture and some nearly empty bedrooms. Scavenging the area will grant 500 credits.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 8:</b> Another factory floor area, with many precision manufacturing machines and a clean room containing electronics
				manufacturing machines, all of which are water-damaged, but operational. 2
				<a href="#refurbished-maintenance-bot">refurbished maintenance bots</a> and 2
				<a href="#decaying-maintenance-bot">decaying maintenance bots</a> guard this room.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 9:</b> A room that holds several server towers as well as transformers and circuit breakers. It is guarded by 2
				<a href="#refurbished-maintenance-bot">refurbished maintenance bots</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 10:</b> A room built around a central fusion reactor, with control units and an AI harness at the back. This room is guarded
				by 2 <a href="#refurbished-maintenance-bot">refurbished maintenance bots</a> and <a href="#gears">Gears</a>.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The party returns to <a is="ap-nav-link" href="oleg-contacts#yuri">Yuri</a> and gets paid.</li>

	A barely functioning industrial maintenance robot, these (physically) strong looking robots have most of their inner parts exposed, though
	the mounted rivet gun and welding torch give these robots more than enough to maim anyone foolish enough to consider it as harmless.

	A fully functioning industrial maintenance bot, these physically strong robots have new, if mismatched, plating and move with a swiftness
	their uncared for brethren could not hope for. While not made to deflect weapons fire, the plating of this robot offers it minimal
	protection from intentional harm while its built in rivet gun and welding torch offer it the ability to return the favor.
