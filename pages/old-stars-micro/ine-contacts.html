<h1>Ine's Contacts</h1>
<h2 id="tyreck-mais">Shaman Tyreck Mais</h2>
<p>
	One of the local shamans of <a is="ap-nav-link" href="tenrikyo">Tenrikyo</a>, Shaman Mais typically handles Ine's watch of templars. As
	per his position, Shaman Mais keeps careful watch over the movements of local animals and predators (in particular), nearby pirates and
	raiders, violent religious sects, and whatever else might be a threat to
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#beachtopia">Beachtopia's</a> flock.
</p>
<p>
	Tyreck is a 6' 5" tall, male catfolk with brown and gray, tabby patterned fur, long, wide and untufted ears and green eyes. Tyreck
	normally wears a set of lightweight, green and blue, silken robes with several pendants depicting the various gods of
	<a is="ap-nav-link" href="tenrikyo">Tenrikyo</a>. Underneath the robes is a loincloth with either boots or sandals, depending on the
	terrain he is expecting to be on that day.
</p>

<h2 id="ervan-roan">Dispatch Officer Ervan Roan</h2>
<p>
	A dispatch officer for <a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#beachtopia">Beachtopia's</a> police force, Ervan normally handles templar and
	SWAT dispatch. While normally waiting around for the next big event too difficult for normal police to handle, Ervan gathers reports that
	the police either can't act on (for legal reasons or because they'll spook someone they can't yet arrest) or that are outside normal
	police jurisdiction, offering these reports to templars in need of busy work.
</p>
<p>
	Ervan is a 5' 10" tall, male human with tanned skin, short, spiked brown hair and brown eyes with an orange tint. When on duty, Ervan
	wears the standard dark gray with bright yellow stripes uniform of the <a is="ap-nav-link" href="thorunn#beachtopia">Beachtopia</a> police
	force with a thermal pistol and a stun baton on his hips. When off duty, Ervan will normally wear a light t-shirt and a pair of shorts
	(type varies by what he's planning on doing) with sandals or hiking shoes.
