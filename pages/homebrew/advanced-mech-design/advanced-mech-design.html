<p>
	The purpose of the Advanced Mech Design homebrew is to provide a mech building system with a greater level of customization while
	remaining compatible with the combat system of Stars Without Number and Stars Without Number Revised. While the current mech system is
	sufficient when mechs are secondary, it quickly becomes limiting if the mechs are intended to become the center of the campaign.
</p>
<p>
	This mech building system borrows heavily from mech building concepts in the Armored Core franchise, and as such the rules provided within
	assume most mechs to be highly modular.

<h2 id="building-a-mech">Building a Mech</h2>
<p>
	The process of building a mech, while similar to the original mech building system, is slightly different. Mech construction begins by
	choosing a frame, which determines base stats for the mech like health points and dodge, after which a power source is chosen, then the
	mech's mobility systems and its plating, followed by the arms, which will determine what weapon hardpoints are available to the mech, with
	fittings and weapons being figured out last.
</p>

<h3 id="dodge">Dodge</h3>
<p>
	The Dodge score of a mech might seem weird to a player or GM used to Stars Without Number, but it is a renaming of Armor Class to help to
	avoid confusion with the separate Armor score.
</p>

<h2 id="modifying-a-mech">Modifying a Mech</h2>
<p>
	Replacing a single part or fitting on a mech takes 2 hours of work, swapping a single weapon takes 30 minutes of work, and a full rebuild
	takes 8 hours of work. Replacing a part, adding a part, or building a mech requires a trained technician and a mech harness.
