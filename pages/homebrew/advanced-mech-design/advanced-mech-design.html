<p>
	The purpose of the Advanced Mech Design homebrew is to provide a mech building system with a greater level of customization while
	remaining compatible with the combat system of Stars Without Number and Stars Without Number Revised. While the current mech system is
	sufficient when mechs are secondary, it quickly becomes limiting if the mechs are intended to become the center of the campaign.
</p>
<p>
	This mech building system borrows heavily from mech building concepts in the Armored Core franchise, and as such the rules provided within
	assume most mechs to be highly modular.
</p>

<h2 id="building-a-mech">Building a Mech</h2>
<p>
	The process of building a mech, while similar to the original mech building system, is slightly different. Mech construction begins by
	choosing a frame and mobility system, which determines base stats for the mech like health points and dodge, after which a power source is
	chosen, then the mech's mobility systems and its plating, followed by the arms, which will determine what weapon hardpoints are available
	to the mech, with fittings and weapons being figured out last.
</p>

<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>
	The Speed score of a mech is a representation of its agility and forward speed. A mech can move a number of meters per Move Action equal
	to its Speed score multiplied by 20. When being used in chases or performing manuevers calling for agility and coordination, add the Speed
	score to the Piloting skill roll.
</p>
<p>
	A mech pilot can choose to move at any speed equal to, or less than, the Speed score of the mech they are piloting. This sets the
	effective Speed score of the mech to the Speed score selected, affecting the distance able to be covered in a single Move Action, the
	penalty to hit for weapons with the Unstable special weapon quality, the bonus to Piloting skill rolls and any other bonus or penalty
	derived from the mech's speed score. For every point of Speed score below the mech's maximum speed score, reduce the Dodge score of the
	mech by 1.
</p>

<h3 id="dodge">Dodge</h3>
<p>
	The Dodge score of a mech might seem weird to a player or GM used to Stars Without Number, but it is a renaming of Armor Class to help to
	avoid confusion with the separate Armor score. It represents the Difficulty Class of hitting the mech with an attack.
</p>

<h3 id="reinforcement">Reinforcement</h3>
<p>
	The Reinforcement score of a mech might seem weird to a player or GM used to Stars Without Number, but it is this system's equivalent to
	the Hardened Polyceramic Overlay or Vanguard Plating. The Reinforcement score is the amount of Armor Penetration negated when a mech
	weapon damages the mech.
</p>

<h2 id="modifying-a-mech">Modifying a Mech</h2>
<p>
	Replacing a single part or fitting on a mech takes 2 hours of work, swapping a single weapon takes 30 minutes of work, and a full rebuild
	takes 8 hours of work. Replacing a part, adding a part, or building a mech requires a trained technician and a mech harness.
</p>

<h2 id="repairs-and-maintenance">Repairs and Maintenance</h2>
<p>
	Mechs are complicated pieces of machinery and require regular maintenance to prevent them from breaking down. Mechs require maintenance
	once for every 24 hours that the mech has been active, the cost of which is determined by the frame's maintenance score. Every 24 hours
	the mech spends active without maintenance, the mech takes -1 to all actions the mech takes, with the mech ceasing to be functional after
	reaching a -5 maintenance penalty. A single maintenance cycle removes all maintenance penalties.
</p>
<p>
	Maintenance for a light frame takes 1 hour, a medium frame takes 2 hours and a heavy frame 4 hours. Static frames take half as long for
	maintenance.
