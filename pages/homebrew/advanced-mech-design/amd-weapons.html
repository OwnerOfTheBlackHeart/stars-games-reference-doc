<h2 id="special-weapon-qualities">Special Weapon Qualities</h2>
<h3 id="accurate">Accurate</h3>
<p>
	This weapon is highly accurate and easy to hit targets with, such as a laser. This weapon gains +1 to rolls to hit a target. The pilot can
	take a special Aim Move Action to focus on aiming to instead gain a +2 to rolls to hit a target. This is the same Aim action as used by
	weapons with the Ballistic special weapon quality.
</p>

<h3 id="anti-air">Anti-Air</h3>
<p>
	This weapon is optimized for firing at “clean” airborne targets, however, and suffers a -4 penalty to hit when aiming for ground-bound
	targets.
</p>

<h3 id="anti-personnel">Anti-Personnel</h3>
<p>Armored vehicles, fortifications, and mechs are immune to these light weapons.</p>

<h3 id="anti-vehicle">Anti-Vehicle</h3>
<p>Against armored vehicles and fortifications, roll damage twice and take the higher damage number.</p>

<h3 id="ammo">Ammo</h3>
<p>
	The weapon or defense requires ammunition to fire. A number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Ammo rating can be fit into one Ammo Bin
	fitting. The weapon itself includes one Ammo Bin fitting worth of ammunition as part of the installation. A weapon's ammunition is
	refilled as part of a normal maintenance cycle.
</p>

<h3 id="ap">AP</h3>
<p>
	The weapon ignores this many points of a target’s armor. Reinforcement reduces the effective AP, down to a minimum of 0. It cannot add
	additional damage to a hit.
</p>

<h3 id="ballistic">Ballistic</h3>
<p>
	This weapon operates by accelerating a solid projectile of appreciable mass to speeds faster than the speed of sound. All ballistic
	weapons are inherently Ammo weapons. Mechs with the Stability Quadrupedal Mobility System can take a special Aim Move Action to focus on
	aiming to gain a +1 bonus on rolls to hit a target. This is the same Aim action as used by weapons with the Accurate special weapon
	quality.
</p>

<h3 id="cone">Cone</h3>
<p>
	The weapon fires in a conical pattern that many meters long and wide at its end. All targets within the cone must make an Evasion saving
	throw or be hit, with no hit roll required. Targets behind hard cover save automatically.
</p>

<h3 id="melee">Melee</h3>
<p>
	Melee weapons can only be used in hand-to-hand combat, and no non-melee weapon can be used that same round. Pilots use either Punch or
	Stab for hit rolls. Mech melee weapons do not inflict Shock damage against mechs with a Reinforcement score higher than the weapon's AP.
</p>

<h3 id="psi">Psi</h3>
<p>
	Psi weapons use metadimensional energy channels to completely ignore a target’s Armor rating, except for any armor granted by the MES
	Shunt Channel defense fitting. Defenses such as Hardened Polyceramic Overlay have no effect on psi weaponry. Pilots may optionally choose
	to use an appropriate psychic skill with psi weapons, even melee varieties. Psi weapons rely on Wisdom or Constitution to modify attack
	and damage rolls, rather than Dexterity or Intelligence.
</p>

<h3 id="slow">Slow</h3>
<p>
	After firing, the attacker must roll an Int/Shoot skill check against difficulty 8. For psi weapons, use Int and an applicable psychic
	skill. On a failure, the gun must cool down for one round before it can be fired again.
</p>

<h3 id="unstable">Unstable</h3>
<p>
	This weapon takes a penalty to rolls to hit targets equal to the speed score the mech is moving at. Mechs with the Stability Quadrupedal
	Mobility System ignore this special weapon quality.
