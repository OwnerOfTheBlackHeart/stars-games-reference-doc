<h1 id="weapons">Weapons</h1>
<h2 id="special-weapon-qualities">Special Weapon Qualities</h2>
<h3 id="accurate">Accurate</h3>
<p>
	This weapon is highly accurate and easy to hit targets with, such as a laser. This weapon gains +1 to rolls to hit a target. The pilot can
	take a special Aim Move Action to focus on aiming to instead gain a +2 to rolls to hit a target. This is the same Aim action as used by
	weapons with the Ballistic special weapon quality.
</p>

<h3 id="anti-air">Anti-Air</h3>
<p>
	This weapon is optimized for firing at “clean” airborne targets, however, and suffers a -4 penalty to hit when aiming for ground-bound
	targets.
</p>

<h3 id="anti-personnel">Anti-Personnel</h3>
<p>Armored vehicles, fortifications, and mechs are immune to these light weapons.</p>

<h3 id="anti-vehicle">Anti-Vehicle</h3>
<p>Against armored vehicles and fortifications, roll damage twice and take the higher damage number.</p>

<h3 id="ammo">Ammo</h3>
<p>
	The weapon or defense requires ammunition to fire. A number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Ammo rating can be fit into one Ammo Bin
	fitting. The weapon itself includes one Ammo Bin fitting worth of ammunition as part of the installation. A weapon's ammunition is
	refilled as part of a normal maintenance cycle.
</p>

<h3 id="ap">AP</h3>
<p>
	The weapon ignores this many points of a target’s armor. Reinforcement reduces the effective AP, down to a minimum of 0. It cannot add
	additional damage to a hit.
</p>

<h3 id="ballistic">Ballistic</h3>
<p>
	This weapon operates by accelerating a solid projectile of appreciable mass to speeds faster than the speed of sound. All ballistic
	weapons are inherently Ammo weapons. Mechs with the Stability Quadrupedal Mobility System can take a special Aim Move Action to focus on
	aiming to gain a +1 bonus on rolls to hit a target. This is the same Aim action as used by weapons with the Accurate special weapon
	quality.
</p>

<h3 id="cone">Cone</h3>
<p>
	The weapon fires in a conical pattern that many meters long and wide at its end. All targets within the cone must make an Evasion saving
	throw or be hit, with no hit roll required. Targets behind hard cover save automatically.
</p>

<h3 id="melee">Melee</h3>
<p>
	Melee weapons can only be used in hand-to-hand combat, and no non-melee weapon can be used that same round. Pilots use either Punch or
	Stab for hit rolls. Mech melee weapons do not inflict Shock damage against mechs with a Reinforcement score higher than the weapon's AP.
	Melee weapons can only be mounted in hand mounts.
</p>

<h3 id="psi">Psi</h3>
<p>
	Psi weapons use metadimensional energy channels to completely ignore a target’s Armor rating, except for any armor granted by the MES
	Shunt Channel defense fitting. Defenses such as Hardened Polyceramic Overlay have no effect on psi weaponry. Pilots may optionally choose
	to use an appropriate psychic skill with psi weapons, even melee varieties. Psi weapons rely on Wisdom or Constitution to modify attack
	and damage rolls, rather than Dexterity or Intelligence.
</p>

<h3 id="slow">Slow</h3>
<p>
	After firing, the attacker must roll an Int/Shoot skill check against difficulty 8. For psi weapons, use Int and an applicable psychic
	skill. On a failure, the gun must cool down for one round before it can be fired again.
</p>

<h3 id="imprecise">Imprecise</h3>
<p>
	This weapon is designed to be used against large targets, such as mechs, vehicles or fortifications. Against targets of human size, or
	smaller, the weapon applies a -4 to any hit rolls against them.
</p>

<h3 id="unstable">Unstable</h3>
<p>
	This weapon takes a penalty to rolls to hit targets equal to the speed score the mech is moving at. Mechs with the Stability Quadrupedal
	Mobility System ignore this special weapon quality.
</p>

<h3 id="radius">Radius</h3>
<p>
	This weapon targets a location rather than a single creature, vehicle or mech. All attack rolls are against AC 10, with a miss indicating
	the shot has gone wide. All creatures, vehicles or mechs in the area may attempt an Evasion Save, taking half damage on a success or full
	damage on a failure. On a miss, roll a d8 for direction, with 1 being the direction the mech is facing, and each after being another 45
	degrees clockwise (3 is to the right, 5 is towards the mech, 7 is to the left), and a 1d20 for the number of meters off target the attack
	lands.
</p>

<h3 id="multitarget">Multitarget</h3>
<p>
	This weapon is made up of multiple sub-weapons that are capable of independent targeting. The gunner designates up to the Multitarget
	score in targets and can then make the same number of rolls to hit divided among them. Each successful hit on a target allows the gunner
	to roll damage once, but only the highest damage roll is applied to the target. Thus, if three volleys were aimed at a single target and
	two of them hit, the gunner would roll damage twice and apply the best result.
