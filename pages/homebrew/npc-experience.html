<h1>NPC Leveling</h1>
<p>
	In most games, having NPCs that do not improve, or that lack a rigid means of improving, is fine. However, in games where a majority of
	the party is NPCs, this can become a hindrance. The NPC Leveling system is intended to provide a way for NPCs to improve with use, to
	allow favored NPCs to become absolute powerhouses and to make it feel like the experiences the NPCs endure have an actual impact upon
	them.
</p>

<h2 id="experience">Experience (XP)</h2>
<p>
	Much like player characters, NPCs using the NPC Leveling system keep track of experience. However, they do not gain, or use, XP in the
	same way as players.
</p>

<h2 id="gaining-xp">Gaining XP</h2>
<p>
	NPCs gain XP by completing missions, at the end of which they gain 1 XP if they have attempted anything useful, such as shooting at an
	enemy or making a skill check, regardless of success or failure. Killing a Player Classed enemy or killing an enemy at least 2 hit dice
	above their current hit dice also grants 1 XP.
</p>

<h2 id="spending-xp">Spending XP</h2>
<p>
	NPCs can spend their XP to improve their Hit Dice, Attack, Damage, or Skill, or to acquire a Foci. In order to be able to spend their XP,
	an NPC must be in a unthreatened and in a safe location (such as the controlling player's starship) for at least 24 hours. The list of
	costs is shown in the table below.
