<h1>Protomechs</h1>
<p>
	Standing 2 to 2.8 meters (6' 6" to 9' 2") and powered by high capacity batteries, or some form of fuel burning engine, protomechs are the
	tools of those who need better powered armor, but can't afford mechs, or who are looking to fill the tactical gap between the two
	capabilities. Protomechs represent the largest a powered armor system can get without the combination of micro-fusion generators and grav
	plates, or other fenceposting protections.
</p>
<p>
	Protomechs are notably weaker than mechs, with their armor scores being similar to that of vehicles, where the damage is taken off of
	non-gunnery weapons while gunnery weapons completely ignore the armor. Also unlike mechs, protomechs can use a number of fittings, similar
	to drones. The standard battery included in a protomech lasts for 12 hours per charge, providing full life support as a suit of powered
	armor for that time, and takes 24 hours to charge when connected to a stable power source such as a city electric grid or starship power
	system.
</p>
<p>
	Protomech pilots are able to use any weapons or equipment that they carry with them into battle with them. Protomechs do not have a health
	value of their own, requiring any pilot to take the damage themselves.
</p>
<p>
	Light protomechs are barely more than powered armor and stand 10 to 20 centimeters taller than their user and can be compressed down to a
	4 enc item, with every mounted item's encumbrance being added as well (gunnery weapons without a listed encumbrance count as 4). Medium
	protomechs stand around 2.4 meters tall and take up 2 tons of starship cargo space. Heavy protomechs stand around 2.8 meters tall and take
	up 5 tons of starship cargo space. Starship Vehicle Transport Fittings affect medium and heavy protomechs as if they were vehicles, with
	heavy protomechs rounding down to 2 tons of starship cargo space.
</p>

<h2 id="building-protomechs">Modding and Building Protomechs</h2>
<p>
	Protomechs use the normal item creation and modification rules, except that they are able to be built in powered armor or mech workshops,
	taking 1 month to assemble for a single engineer. Protomechs can accept armor mods and integrated weapons can take weapon mods.
</p>

<h2 id="hulls">Hulls</h2>
<p>
	Hulls are the physical protomechs themselves and come in two types, military and industrial, and three weight categories, light, medium
	and heavy. Industrial hulls are only capable of mounting a single weapon regardless of size and provide a +2 bonus to any Strength/Exert
	or Constitution/Exert skill checks, and double the effect of any fittings that improve carry load. Military hulls are designed for
	mounting multiple weapons and have an easier time mounting armor (see the description for the Armor fitting).

<p>
	Fittings, the means for protomechs to ascend beyond simple suits of armor. Some provide simple, numerical bonuses, while other provide
	distinct abilities and tools for the pilot of the protomech to use. Most fittings can only be applied a limited number of times, as seen
	in their full description. If a fitting doesn't explicitly state it can be installed more than once, it can only be installed once.

			<i class="item-name">Climbing Systems</i> enable the protomech to climb any surface capable of bearing its weight at its normal
			movement speed. While using a climbing system, only a one handed weapon or a weapon in a <a href="#weapon-mount">weapon mounts</a> can
			be used. Two handed weapons and weapons located in a <a href="#heavy-weapon-mount">heavy weapon mount</a> or a
			<a href="#mech-weapon-mount">mech weapon mount</a> require too much of the body to be moved to be used with any effect other than
			boring a hole directly in front of the protomech when the climbing system is in use.

			<i class="item-name">Vehicle mount systems</i> enable the protomech to externally attach to a vehicle. While vehicles designed to
			carry large numbers of passengers or cargo, such as most aircraft, ATV explorers, IFVs and APCs, can fit a protomech without much
			issue, smaller vehicles such as civilian cars lack the internal space for the protomech effectively operate. When attached to a
			vehicle via vehicle mount systems, a protomech counts as 1 passenger, can only fire a single pistol sized weapon or a single weapon
			mount, and does not gain any protection against direct attack. Mounting a vehicle takes an Action while dismounting safely from a
			moving vehicle requires a Move Action. Dismounting from a stationary vehicle takes an On Turn Action. Vehicle mount systems can be
			installed directly into the protomech for 1 fitting slot, carried by a protomech as a 4 encumbrance item, or installed directly onto a
			vehicle.
