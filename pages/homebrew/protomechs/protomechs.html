<h1>Protomechs</h1>
<p>
	Standing 2 to 2.5 meters (6' 6" to 8' 2") and powered by high capacity batteries, or some form of fuel burning engine, protomechs are the
	tools of those who need better powered armor, but can't afford mechs, or who are looking to fill the tactical gap between the two
	capabilities. Protomechs represent the largest a powered armor system can get without the combination of micro-fusion generators and grav
	plates, or other fenceposting protections.
