<h1>Technomancy</h1>
<p>
	While one might assume that technomancy, by its name, is a psionic discipline or SANIS interface tradition, however technomancy is the
	ability to use technologies so advanced and strange as to seem arcane. Anyone can learn to use technomancy, but the task is difficult and
	the path is expensive, leaving most unwilling to show the dedication necessary to become a technomancer.
</p>
<p>
	To become a technomancer, a character must first acquire the Technomancer foci, which represents their dedication to learning the strange,
	varied, finicky, and advanced technologies required to use technomancy. Technomancers have Technomancer Effort, which is equal to 1 plus
	their intelligence modifier plus the higher of their Fix or Program skill levels, and committed similar to Psychic or Adept Effort.
</p>
<p>
	Technomancers display their power through Devices, pieces of technology that the technomancer uses to augment their abilities or perform
	seemingly arcane actions. The limit as to how many devices a technomancer can use is how many they can carry, with each device taking up 1
	encumbrance. A technomancer can use devices of a skill level equal to, or below, the highest of their Fix or Program skill levels.
</p>
<p>
	In order for a technomancer to use a Technomancer Device, the device must be readied. Otherwise, the technomancy must go through the
	normal processes for accessing the device as if it were a normal encumbrance item before it can be used.
</p>

<h2 id="technomancer-foci">Technomancer (foci)</h2>
<p>
	You have invested a great deal of time in learning technologies so advanced and foreign to your peers as to be mistaken for psionics or
	magic. You, however, know the truth: They are simply machines, devices, that require a trained hand and a keen mind.
</p>
<p>
	<i class="power">Level 1:</i> Gain Fix or Program as a bonus skill. You gain Technomancer Effort equal to 1 plus your intelligence
	modifier plus the higher of your Fix or Program skill levels. You also gain the ability to create and utilize Technomancer Devices of a
	skill level equal to, or below, the highest of your Fix or Program skill levels. If taken at level 1, you start with a single level 1
	Technomancer Device of your choosing.
</p>
<p>
	<i class="power">Level 2:</i> Your mastery of technomancy vastly improves. You can now bundle devices, though it comes with the same
	advantages and drawbacks as bundling any other encumbrance item. New Technomancer Devices you craft cost half as many credits, you require
	a pretech toolbox in place of the normal workshop, and you can treat your Fix skill level as equal to your Program skill level when
	building Technomancer Devices. You gain one free technomancer device for each skill level of 1, or higher, you have in the highest of Fix
	or Program (for example, 2 program would grant 1 level 1 device and 1 level 2 device), which do not cost credits, pretech scrap or
	encumbrance, but can be swapped around with 8 hours of work.
</p>

<h2 id="devices">Technomancer Devices</h2>
<p>
	Devices are the tools by which technomancy is performed, and the reason why technomancy is so rare. Each device has a level, effect and
	class, and weighs 1 encumbrance, with only readied devices being able to be utilized without needing to take a turn to unstow them. The
	level is the minimum Fix or Program skill required by a technomancer to build or operate the device. The effect is what the device does,
	including if the device requires Committing Effort. The class of a device describes what class, or classes, the device is most effectively
	used by, granting technomancers of that class an improved effect, which is listed in the device's effect.
</p>
<p>
	Crafting Technomancer Devices requires a technomancer's workshop, which are too advanced and strange to be found on a TL4 world, and can
	only rarely be found on a TL5 world, but can be created by an aspiring technomancer, costing 25,000 credits and taking up 2 tons of cargo
	space if installed on a starship. The technomancer must also have a Fix or Program skill level equal to, or higher than, the device they
	are trying to create, and must have a Fix skill level, or a willing and available technician with a Fix skill level, equal to, or higher
	than, the device they are trying to create. The technomancer must provide a pretech scrap and 5,000 credits worth of part per level of the
	device. Once all the above requirements are met, the technomancer creates the device, taking only 2 days if they are building it
	themselves, or a week if they are involving a technician. If the technician is another technomancer, it only takes 2 days to build the
	device.

<h4 id="weapon-enhancement-system">Weapon Enhancement System (level 1)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The weapon enhancement system is made up of a quick-change side mount weapon attachment and a eye piece. When
	the weapon enhancement system detects the weapon will hit the target (the technomancer has made a successful attack roll), the device can
	activate, overcharging energy weapons and using micro-gravitic accelerators to give the weapon a little extra kick. If the technomancer
	Commits Effort for the day, the Weapon Enhancement system activates and causes the attack to deal 2 extra damage.
</p>
<p>
	Warriors and partial Warriors using the Weapon Enhancement system instead add the higher of the 2 bonus or base attack bonus as extra
	damage. Full Warriors using the Weapon Enhancement System do not Commit Effort for the day, but instead the scene.
