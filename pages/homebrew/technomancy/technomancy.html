<h1>Technomancy</h1>
<p>
	While one might assume that technomancy, by its name, is a psionic discipline or SANIS interface tradition, however technomancy is the
	ability to use technologies so advanced and strange as to seem arcane. Anyone can learn to use technomancy, but the task is difficult and
	the path is expensive, leaving most unwilling to show the dedication necessary to become a technomancer.
</p>
<p>
	To become a technomancer, a character must first acquire the Technomancer foci, which represents their dedication to learning the strange,
	varied, finicky, and advanced technologies required to use technomancy. Technomancers have Technomancer Effort, which is equal to 1 plus
	their intelligence modifier plus the higher of their Fix or Program skill levels, and committed similar to Psychic or Adept Effort.
</p>
<p>
	Technomancers display their power through Devices, pieces of technology that the technomancer uses to augment their abilities or perform
	seemingly arcane actions. The limit as to how many devices a technomancer can use is how many they can carry, with each device taking up 1
	encumbrance. A technomancer can use devices of a skill level equal to, or below, the highest of their Fix or Program skill levels.
</p>
<p>
	In order for a technomancer to use a Technomancer Device, the device must be readied. Otherwise, the technomancy must go through the
	normal processes for accessing the device as if it were a normal encumbrance item before it can be used.
</p>

<h2 id="technomancer-foci">Technomancer (foci)</h2>
<p>
	You have invested a great deal of time in learning technologies so advanced and foreign to your peers as to be mistaken for psionics or
	magic. You, however, know the truth: They are simply machines, devices, that require a trained hand and a keen mind.
</p>
<p>
	<i class="power">Level 1:</i> Gain Fix or Program as a bonus skill. You gain Technomancer Effort equal to 1 plus your intelligence
	modifier plus the higher of your Fix or Program skill levels. You also gain the ability to create and utilize Technomancer Devices of a
	skill level equal to, or below, the highest of your Fix or Program skill levels. If taken at level 1, you start with a single level 1
	Technomancer Device of your choosing.
</p>
<p>
	<i class="power">Level 2:</i> Your mastery of technomancy vastly improves. You can now bundle devices, though it comes with the same
	advantages and drawbacks as bundling any other encumbrance item. New Technomancer Devices you craft cost half as many credits, you require
	a pretech toolbox in place of the normal workshop, and you can treat your Fix skill level as equal to your Program skill level when
	building Technomancer Devices. You gain one free technomancer device for each skill level of 1, or higher, you have in the highest of Fix
	or Program (for example, 2 program would grant 1 level 1 device and 1 level 2 device), which do not cost credits, pretech scrap or
	encumbrance, but can be swapped around with 8 hours of work.
</p>

<h2 id="devices">Technomancer Devices</h2>
<p>
	Devices are the tools by which technomancy is performed, and the reason why technomancy is so rare. Each device has a level, effect and
	class, and weighs 1 encumbrance, with only readied devices being able to be utilized without needing to take a turn to unstow them. The
	level is the minimum Fix or Program skill required by a technomancer to build or operate the device. The effect is what the device does,
	including if the device requires Committing Effort. The class of a device describes what class, or classes, the device is most effectively
	used by, granting technomancers of that class an improved effect, which is listed in the device's effect.
</p>
<p>
	Crafting Technomancer Devices requires a technomancer's workshop, which are too advanced and strange to be found on a TL4 world, and can
	only rarely be found on a TL5 world, but can be created by an aspiring technomancer, costing 25,000 credits and taking up 2 tons of cargo
	space if installed on a starship. The technomancer must also have a Fix or Program skill level equal to, or higher than, the device they
	are trying to create, and must have a Fix skill level, or a willing and available technician with a Fix skill level, equal to, or higher
	than, the device they are trying to create. The technomancer must provide a pretech scrap and 5,000 credits worth of part per level of the
	device. Once all the above requirements are met, the technomancer creates the device, taking only 2 days if they are building it
	themselves, or a week if they are involving a technician. If the technician is another technomancer, it only takes 2 days to build the
	device.
</p>

<h3 id="warrior-devices">Warrior Devices</h3>
<h4 id="weapon-enhancement-system">Weapon Enhancement System (level 1)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The weapon enhancement system is made up of a quick-change side mount weapon attachment and a eye piece. When
	the weapon enhancement system detects the weapon will hit the target (the technomancer has made a successful attack roll), the device can
	activate, overcharging energy weapons and using micro-gravitic accelerators to give the weapon a little extra kick. If the technomancer
	Commits Effort for the day, the Weapon Enhancement system activates and causes the attack to deal 2 extra damage.
</p>
<p>
	Warriors and partial warriors using the Weapon Enhancement system instead add the higher of the 2 bonus or base attack bonus as extra
	damage. Full warriors using the Weapon Enhancement System do not Commit Effort for the day, but instead the scene.
</p>

<h4 id="hex-shield">Hex Shield (level 1)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The Hex Shield is made up of an arm mounted particle field projector and a grip based activator. If the
	technomancer Commits Effort, the Hex Shield grants the technomancer +1 to AC as long as the technomancer has a hand free, the Hex Shield
	is readied, and the effort remains committed.
</p>
<p>Warriors and partial warriors can use the Hex Shield even when both hands are in use. Full warriors gain 2 AC while using Hex Shield.</p>

<h4 id="controlled-paradox-field">Controlled Paradox Field (level 2)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The Controlled Paradox Field is a belt mounted device which produces a small paradox encased in a
	partially-real electromagnetic casing that prevents the paradox from interacting with reality until casing is breached. The technomancer
	can Commit Effort for the day to make a ranged attack equivalent to a grenade with a damage of 1d8.
</p>
<p>
	Warriors and partial warriors deal 2d6 damage with Controlled Paradox Fields. Full warriors have a 30/100 range when using Controlled
	Paradox Fields.
</p>

<h4 id="gravitic-flachette-system">Gravitic Flechette System (level 2)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The Gravitic Flechette System wraps projectiles and blades within a micro-gravitic field that, when passing
	close enough to a solid object, explodes into a cloud of gravitic flechettes that can harm nearby combatants. On a missed attack, the
	technomancer can Commit Effort for the day to deal 1 damage.
</p>
<p>
	Warriors and partial warriors instead deal the higher of their Fix or Program skills when Gravitic Flechette System is used. Full warriors
	Full warriors using the Gravitic Flechette System do not Commit Effort for the day, but instead the scene.
</p>

<h4 id="optical-interference-projector">Optical Interference Projector (level 2)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The Optical Interference Projector is a small, shoulder mounted device that interferes with the target's
	ability to detect their surroundings. The Optical Interference Projector is only usable by full warriors technomancers, who can, as a Main
	Action, use their Veteran's Luck to negate the next Main Action of a target that they can see unaided. If targeting on a vehicle, mech, or
	(god forbid) a spaceship, the target is unable to make attacks with any of their weapons. To be used while inside a fully enclosed
	vehicle, the Optical Interference Projector must be installed on a specialized mount. To be used in a starship, the Optical Interference
	Projector must be installed on a specialized mount and must be in a "knife fighting" situation, such as during a ramming attempt or while
	closing to board.
</p>

<h4 id="projectile-multiplication-system">Projector Multiplication System (level 3)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The Projector Multiplication System deploys any number of hyper-specialized technologies to effectively turn
	one projectile into a swarm of projectiles covering an area. As a Main Action, the technomancer can Commit Effort for the day and expend 1
	round of ammunition from a ranged weapon to make an area of effect attack within the range of their ranged weapon, which targets an area 5
	meters in radius. The attack does the same damage as the weapon used to all creatures within the target area, with each creature making a
	Reaction Save to take half damage. If the creature is behind cover, passing the Reaction Save negates the damage while failing causes the
	target to take half damage. If the attack is made outside of the weapon's optimal range, all targets gain a +2 bonus to their saving
	throws.
</p>
<p>Warriors and partial warriors ignore cover for the sake of this attack. Full warriors instead target a 7 meter radius area.</p>

<h4 id="neural-overload-system">Neural Overload System (level 3)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The Neural Overload System relies on a seemingly impossible no-contact neural accelerator to overload the
	technomancer's ability to process the world around them. As a Main Action, the technomancer can Commit Effort for the day to make two
	attacks with a weapon.
</p>
<p>
	Warriors and partial warriors using the Neural Overload System do not Commit Effort for the day, but instead the scene. Full warriors
	using both a Neural Overload System and Veteran's Luck apply Veteran's Luck to both attacks.
</p>

<h4 id="tychokinetic-vest">Tychokinetic Vest (Level 4)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The Tychokinetic Vest is considered arcane even by the standards of technomancy, with those who can build
	them often unsure of exactly how they work. Once per scene, as an On Turn action the technomancer can Commit Effort for the day to gain 2
	temporary hit points per character level. The hit points go away when the scene ends and do not heal the user's existing damage.
</p>
<p>
	Warriors and partial warriors using a Tychokinetic Vest instead gain 2 plus the higher of their Constitution or Intelligence modifiers as
	temporary hit points per character level. Full warriors using a Tychokinetic Vest do not Commit Effort for the day, but instead the scene,
	though it can still only be used once per scene.
</p>

<h4 id="energy-reduction-system">Energy Reduction System (Level 4)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The Energy Reduction System is a highly reactive and precise series of grav projectors capable of reducing
	the velocity of incoming projectiles, mitigating a portion of the thermal energy of lasers and plasma, and of disrupting grav planes. As a
	Main Action, the technomancer can Commit Effort for the day to gain an armor value of 4. As with normal vehicle armor, gunnery weapons
	possess enough potential energy that the small amount the Energy Reduction System is able to steal away has no practical effect.
</p>
<p>
	Warriors and partial warriors using an Energy Reduction System instead gain their level in armor. Full warriors using an Energy Reduction
	System may use an Energy Reduction System as an Instant action upon taking damage, after damage is rolled.
</p>

<h3 id="expert-devices">Expert Devices</h3>
<h4 id="semi-sapient-query-system">Semi-Sapient Query System (level 1)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The Semi-Sapient Query System is a augmented reality system of the designer's choosing that is connected to a
	powerful, miniaturized computer dedicated to running an expert system that is only barely less capable than a full VI that rapidly
	provides relevant information to the user as they work. As party of rolling a skill check, the technomancer can Commit Effort for the day
	to gain an automatic assist to the skill check, granting a +1 bonus and requiring only 1 more successful assist to gain the full +2 bonus.
</p>
<p>
	Experts and partial experts using a Semi-Sapient Query instead gain the effect of 2 successful assists, gaining the full +2 bonus without
	any assistance from other characters. Full experts can use a Semi-Sapient Query as part of an assist check, Committing Effort for the
	scene to grant a successful assist on top of their assist check, success or failure.
</p>

<h4 id="socio-muscular-asstance-system">Socio-Muscular Assistance System (level 1)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The Socio-Muscular Assistance System looks similar to a lightweight powered exoskeleton, however it is
	actually a series of non-contact neural control points and a social indicator assistant display. As part of a skill check that uses any
	attribute modifier other than Intelligence, the technomancer may Commit Effort for the day to use Intelligence as the attribute modifier
	for the skill check.
</p>
<p>
	Experts and partial experts gain an extra +1 bonus while using the Socio-Muscular Assistance System. Full experts apply the effects of the
	Socio-Muscular Assistance System to all skill checks made after the Socio-Muscular Assistance System was activated till the end of the
	scene it was used in.
</p>

<h4 id="broad-spectrum-simulation-system">Broad Spectrum Simulation System (level 2)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The Broad Spectrum Simulation System is similar in appearance and function to a mix of the Socio-Muscular
	Assistance System and Semi-Sapient Query System, except that the computation system is designed to simulate the effects of an action up to
	10 seconds into the future. As part of a failed skill check, the technomancer can Commit Effort for the day to reroll the failed skill
	check. Due to the excessive power used and heat generated by the stress of running the comprehensive simulation, a Broad Spectrum
	Simulation System can only be used once per scene.
</p>
<p>
	Experts and partial experts gain an extra +1 bonus while using the Broad Spectrum Simulation System, which stacks with the +1 bonus from
	the Socio-Muscular Assistance System. Full experts can use the Broad Spectrum Simulation System after their expert reroll, if it failed,
	and do not Commit Effort for the day, but instead the scene, though it can still only be used once per scene.
</p>

<h4 id="universal-power-tool">Universal Power Tool (level 2)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The Universal Power Tool looks like an unassuming metal rod until activated, at which point the end of the
	tool changes into a hand tool, powered or unpowered, of the technomancer's command. The technomancer can Commit Effort for the day to
	cause the Universal Power Tool to mimic a non-weapon handheld tool or portable toolkit. The Universal Power Tool maintains this form(s)
	until the end of the scene.
</p>
<p>
	Experts and partial experts can use the Universal Power Tool to mimic a non-weapon, non-pharmaceutical, portable device, such as a
	bio-scanner, but not lift, a lazarus patch, or a medkit (due to the medications contained within). Full experts using a Universal Power
	Tool do not Commit Effort for the day, but instead the scene.
</p>

<h4 id="subliminal-assistance-system">Subliminal Assistance System (level 2)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The Subliminal Assistance System is a miniaturized non-contact neural reader and a small speaker that emits a
	subtle sound when active that assists a targeted listener in focusing on a given task. The Subliminal Assistance System is usable only by
	full expert technomancers, who can expend their skill check reroll for the scene to target an ally who has failed a skill check and allow
	them to reroll the skill check as if they were an expert. To be able to use the Subliminal Assistance System on a target, the technomancer
	must be able to see them, such as directly or through a CCTV system, and be able to speak to them, such as by yelling or using a
	loudspeaker.
</p>

<h4 id="precalculated-limb-manipulator">Precalculated Limb Manipulator (level 3)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The Precalculated Limb Manipulator is thin under-suit of non-contact muscular control systems along with a
	powerful micro-computing device that has the ability to take control of the user when activated. As part of a skill roll, the technomancer
	can Commit Effort for the day to use the higher of their Fix or Program skills in place of the skill being rolled. Due to the intense
	stress on the body that the Precalculated Limb Manipulator can apply, and the thermal load generated by the micro-computer when activated,
	this device can only be used once per scene.
</p>
<p>
	Experts and partial experts gain an extra +1 bonus while using the Precalculated Limb Manipulator, which stacks with the +1 bonus from the
	Socio-Muscular Assistance System and the Broad Spectrum Simulation System. Full experts are also able to replace the attribute modifier
	being used with their Intelligence modifier.
</p>

<h4 id="weapon-control-interface">Weapon Control Interface (level 3)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The Weapon Control Interface is a pair of exoskeleton arms that, when activated, calculate the most optimal
	use of a weapon in the current situation and attempt to execute that plan. As a Main Action, the technomancer can Commit Effort for the
	day to make a single attack roll using Intelligence modifier as the attribute modifier and the higher of Fix or Program as the weapon
	skill. This changes both the attack roll and damage modifier as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
	Experts and partial experts may forgo the attack roll and instead automatically deal minimum damage to the target. Full experts continue
	using their Intelligence modifier and the higher of Fix or Program for all attack rolls for the rest of the scene.
</p>

<h4 id="skill-issue-enforcer">Skill Issue Enforcer (level 4)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The Skill Issue Enforcer takes a seemingly unending number of forms, though the device is often arcane even
	to its creators and users, built through trail and error and good enough rather than the typical understanding. When a character the
	technomancer can see unaided attempts a skill check, the technomancer can Commit Effort for the day as an Instant Action to apply a -1
	penalty to the skill check as well as preventing any assist rolls from being made. If targeting the pilot or gunner of a vehicle, the
	technomancer needs to be able to see the vehicle unaided.
</p>
<p>
	Experts and partial experts instead apply a -2 penalty. Full experts may Commit Effort twice (committing 2 total effort) to force the
	targeted character to roll their skill check at a -1 total modifier.
</p>

<h4 id="perfection-calculation">Perfection Calculation (level 4)</h4>
<p>
	<i class="power">Effect:</i> The single most arcane non-psionic device a technomancer can create, the Perfection Calculation is a small
	computer able to run the Perfect Prediction Algorithm... once. As part of a skill roll, the technomancer can activate the Perfection
	Calculation and automatically succeed the skill roll. This damages the Perfection Calculation, which requires half its cost in repair
	parts and 6 hours of dedicated work to repair and commits all the technomancer's Technomancer Effort for the day, which also disables any
	maintained Effort devices.
</p>
<p>
	Experts and partial experts using a Perfection Calculation can maintain any continuously committed Technomancer Effort devices that were
	maintained during the activation of the Perfection Calculation, though releasing the devices before their Technomancer Effort resets does
	not uncommit the Technomancer Effort. Full experts do not damage the Perfection Calculation upon use.
