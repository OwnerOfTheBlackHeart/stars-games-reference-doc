			<i class="item-name">Shoulder beam cannons</i> are a form of build in weapon that replaces the shoulder with a significantly more
			space efficient artificial muscle and a stored plasma beam weapon. The weapon itself has the same combat statistics as the
			<a class="no-line" href="#plasma-beam-rifle">plasma beam rifle</a>, except that is has no encumbrance, it has a magazine of 10, and
			takes a standard plasma can. If military grade plasmatic material is used, then the should beam cannon counts as a TL 5 weapon, or a
			xenotech weapon in settings where that would be of benefit.
		</p>
		<p>
			When not in use, or readied for combat, the shoulder beam cannon is retracted. While the shoulder beam cannon is retracted, the
			character can wear and use any clothing or armor they could normally wear without the shoulder beam cannon. When extended, the
			shoulder beam cannon can only be used with specially designed clothes or armors, with the exception of clothes that leave the shoulder
			exposed (like a tank top). Retracting or extending a shoulder beam cannon is a move action and can be done as part of normal movement
			and can rip through standard casual clothing. A shoulder beam cannon does not count towards duel wielding.
		</p>
		<p>
			Shoulder beam cannons come in two forms of installation: obvious and disguised. Obvious versions are often used by super-soldiers and
			cyber-ninjas as a backup weapon, and appear as the entire shoulder being made of metal which is obviously a weapon to TL4, and higher,
			sensors. Disguised versions are typically used by assassins and guards, appearing as the user's natural shoulder to anything short of
			surgical examination and is able to bypass TL4 weapons sensors as well as simple TL5 weapons sensors.
