<h1 id="ammunition">Ammunition</h1>
<p>
	While Stars Without Number and Stars Without Number Revised Edition normally abstract ammunition types to a sufficient degree for normal
	space opera play, the ammunition types listed here (and in all the weapons lists) remove a layer of abstraction so that requires players
	to track ammunition for their different weapon types and have reason to be more careful in their looting, carrying and purchasing of
	ammunition.

		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Arrows</i> are an arrowhead, shaft and fins coming in a dizzying variety of materials, from stone, wood and

			arrows are considered TL 1 weapons regardless of which weapon fires them, while TL 4 arrows treat the weapon that fires them as TL4.
			Arrows can be fired from most crossbows, trading damage for range.
		</p>
		<p>
			Arrows can be mounted with grenades and a contact fuse. An arrow mounted such a way takes up the same encumbrance as the grenade
			attached to it. When fired from a bow, roll the attack roll with Combat/Projectile or Shoot, and the range of the bow, but otherwise
			use the rules for the grenade used.

		<p>

	<div id="plasma-can" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Plasma and heavy plasma cans</i> are tubes with batteries attached that contain a volatile mix of materials that,

			rechargers and (possibly) rare materials.
		</p>
		<p>
			TL 4, or higher, worlds may have plasma rechargers at factories using plasma cutters and welders as well as at military installations.
			Most of the time these facilities are not available to the public without special permit, but when they are available it usually costs
			2 credits to recharges a plasma can and 15 credits to recharge a heavy plasma can.
		</p>
		<p>
			For weapons that use plasma and heavy plasma cans, one can counts as a whole magazine. The battery of a plasma can, or heavy plasma
