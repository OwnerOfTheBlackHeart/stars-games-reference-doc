		<p><i class="item-name">Plasma rechargers</i> are devices used to recharge plasma cans.</p>
		<p>
			Portable rechargers can be carried by a single person and used in the field, recharging a single plasma can or heavy plasma can at
			once.
		</p>
		<p>
			Immobile plasma rechargers can charge up to 12 plasma cans or heavy plasma cans at once. They are too large to be carried by a single
			person, but they can be placed on a vehicle for 300kg.
		</p>
		<p>
			Plasma rechargers require electricity in order to recharge the power cells within plasma cans. A normal plasma can requires 1 unit of
			plasmatic material to recharge while a heavy plasma can requires 5 units of plasmatic material.
		</p>

	<div id="plasmatic-material" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Plasmatic material</i> is a combination of materials that, when energized, rapidly forms into super heated
			plasma. While these mixtures usually have industrial and military uses on TL 4, or higher, worlds, they are rarely available to
			civilians without special permissions.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="military-plasmatic-material" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Military grade plasmatic material</i> is a form of plasmatic materials optimized for use in weapons. This variant
			of plasmatic material is not sold publicly except on worlds with laws on weapons ownership similar to pre-gangster America.
		</p>
		<p>
			When a plasma can or heavy plasma can filled with military grade plasmatic material is loaded into a plasma weapon, the weapon adds +1
			damage per damage die (+2 if gunnery) of the weapon. If used with the plasma sheath weapon modification, military grade plasmatic
			material adds an extra +1 (+2 if gunnery or sniper rifle) to damage and non-gunnery weapons count as gunnery weapons for the sake of
			over coming armor.
		</p>
		<p>
			Military grade plasmatic material is even more unstable than normal plasmatic and cannot be used with tools that use plasmatic
			material, unless they are explicitly designed to handle the stresses of military grade plasmatic material.
