			<i class="item-name">Plasma sheaths</i> are devices that magnetically charge metallic slugs and wrap them with a layer of plasma. This
			makes the projectile more dangerous, but means the weapon now consumes plasmatic material and that the projectile glows as it travels
			to its target.
		</p>
		<p>
			Plasma sheaths can only be applied to projectile weapons, projectile-based gunnery weapons (like the HMG and Railcannon), and
			rocket/missile launchers. The strong magnetic field required to make the plasma sheath work prevents it from being used with smart
			munitions, as it would fry the electronics. An installed plasma sheath can be activated or deactivated as a movement actions.
		</p>
		<p>
			When activated, the plasma sheath adds +2 to the damage of the weapon (or +4 if the weapons is gunnery or a sniper rifle) and makes
			the weapon count as TL4 for the sake of over coming armor. If the weapon has a magazine of 50, or greater, then it uses a heavy plasma
			can and can fire 100 shots before depleting the heavy plasma can. If the weapon is a gunnery weapon with a magazine of less than 50,
			then it uses a heavy plasma can and can fire 10 shots before depleting it. If it is a projectile weapon with a magazine less than 50,
			then it uses a plasma can and depletes it after 40 shots.
		</p>
		<p>
			This weapon modification requires fix 3 and 1 pretech scrap in order to install. If this mod is found, or purchased, in a pre-made kit
			(typically at least twice the price), it only requires fix 1 to install.
