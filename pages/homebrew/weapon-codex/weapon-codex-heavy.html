		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Anti-tank missiles</i> are a family of man-portable gunnery weapons come in a dizzying array of models and
			flavors, all dedicated to blowing up tanks and similar heavy obstacles. Anti-tank missiles always use the anti-vehicle weapon optional
			rules, even if they aren’t otherwise used in a game. TL3 missiles count as anti-vehicle against TL3 tanks and armored cars, while TL4
			missiles are more destructive, and count as anti-vehicle weapons against more sophisticated TL4 armors.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anti-tank missiles are direct fire weapons, and require the operator to get a direct line of sight to the target. Their bulk and
			single-shot nature make them burdensome to a fireteam, but if their commanders have any anticipation of encountering armor in the
			field a fireteam can expect them to be issued.
		</p>

	<div id="medium-machinegun" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Medium machine guns</i> are a family of air and water cooled automatic weapons designed for taking out infantry
			at range. Unless the machine gun is mounted to a vehicle or emplaced position, the machine gun is incapable of suppressive fire or
			spray and pray.
		</p>
		<p>
			A medium machine gun only ignores 4 points of armor when used against a vehicle or suit mech, but does have the ability to spray and
			pray, using 2 ammunition (20 rifle rounds) and gaining a +4 to hit and damage against a single target.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="heavy-machinegun" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Heavy machine guns</i> are a family of air and water cooled automatic weapons designed for taking out vehicles.
			Unless the heavy machine gun is mounted to a vehicle or emplaced position, the machine gun is incapable of suppressive fire.
		</p>
		<p>
			Heavy machine guns are too heavy to be effective without being mounted. When the weapon isn't mounted to a vehicle, tripod, or similar
			sturdy mounting, it takes a -6 to all attacks.

		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Flame cannons</i> and <i class="item-name">plasma scythes</i> are similar weapons, both firing gouts of searing
			flame over a wide area. TL3 flame cannons usually rely on napalm or similar combustibles, while TL4 plasma scythes emit bursts of
			briefly self-sustaining plasma compounds. These weapons can only be fired in suppressive fire mode, as they’re too imprecise for
			targeting specific enemies.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="cannon" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Light cannons, cannons, and heavy cannons</i> are single shot vehicle weapons that fire large, solid projectiles
			called shells. These are the preferred vehicle to vehicle weapons of the old world. The designs presented here have magazines that
			autoload into the cannon, but some makers prefer to have these weapons manually loaded to increase flexibility. Such cannons only have
			a magazine of one, but the shell is loaded directly into the firing mechanism allowing greater flexibility in ammo type.
		</p>
		<p>Heavy cannons are sometimes referred to as rifled tank guns.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="burst-cannon" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Burst cannons</i>, also called autocannons, are automatic firearms that fire rounds so big they are considered
			shells. Often slower firing than traditional machine guns, burst cannons cannot suppress, but pack a bigger punch.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="artillery-cannon" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Artillery cannons</i>, also known as mobile howitzer, are cannons intended to be fired extremely long ranges.
			These weapons are ineffective at close range or against moving targets, but can target fixed locations. An artillery cannon shot has a
			damage radius of 50 meters.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="rocket-launcher" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Rocket launchers</i> cover a wide variety of man-portable missile launchers of varying degrees of sophistication.
			The weapons are usually equipped with basic tracking sensors, but are of limited accuracy against human-sized targets. Rocket
			launchers take a -4 hit penalty against targets of human size or smaller. Unlike most Gunnery weapons, rocket launchers can be
			shoulder-fired without a prepared emplacement to support them.
		</p>
		<p>
			The normal rocket used in a rocket launcher is intended for anti-armor and has no blast radius, but rerolls 1s on damage rolls. When
			loaded for anti-infantry, the damage drops to 3d6, takes no penalty when firing at human-sized targets, doesn't count as a gunnery
			weapon for the sake of armor penetration, and has a blast radius of 10 meters. When an anti-infantry rocket misses, it lands 2d20
			meters away in a random direction.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="rocket-pod" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Rocket pods</i>, also called hydra arrays, are pods of lighter rockets designed to be fired in bursts and cover
			areas in suppressive fire. Rocket pods are normally loaded with anti-infantry rockets, but can be loaded with high explosive rockets
			that deal the same amount of damage, but have a blast radius of 5 meters and penetrate vehicle armor on a direct hit.
		</p>
		<p>
			The gunner of a rocket pod may designate up to three attack rolls (with target), each attack roll uses up 1 rocket. Each successful
			hit on a target allows the gunner to roll damage once, but only the highest damage roll on a given target applies.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="guided-missiles" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Hunter drones and smart missiles</i> are high and low-tech versions of essentially the same weapon. Both fire
			hyper-accurate guided munitions at a chosen target. Smart missiles always roll against AC 10, no matter how agile the target may be,
			and hunter drones miss only on a natural 1 on the roll and can dodge around corners and other obstacles. These weapons are rendered
			useless by the quantum ECM employed on any modern battlefield or military installation.

			<i class="item-name">Grenade launchers</i> launch explosive projectiles (usually grenades) at far greater distances than a human arm.
			Grenade launchers use specialized grenades that cost twice as much, but can be thrown or launched.
		</p>
		<p>
			Two major variants of the grenade launcher exist: Under-barrel and hand-held. Under-barrel grenade launchers can be attached to any
			rifle, have a magazine of 1, add 1 encumbrance to the weapon, and allow the grenade to be fired without switching weapons. Hand-held
			grenade launchers have a magazine of 6, an encumbrance of 2, and are a separate weapon.

			power grenades, these launch heavier grenades farther than a normal grenade launcher. Most grenade cannons are belt fed, but some use
			large magazines to feed munitions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Grenade cannons use specialized grenades that cost 4 times as much, but increase their damage by one die (d4 to d6 to d8 to d10 to d12
			to d20) and their radius by one half.

	<div id="demo-charge" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Demo charges</i> are the general run of placed explosives beloved of terrorists and adventurers the world over.
			The usual variety can be detonated by radio signals, timers, or electrical charges, and inflict their damage on any objects within
			twenty meters, with an Evasion saving throw for half damage. Victims within forty meters take half damage, with an Evasion save for
			none. The charge is sufficient to blow a four-meter wide hole in anything short of a reinforced wall. PCs with a background in
			demolitions or Fix-0 skill can shape the charge so it directs the blast in only one direction, sparing all but two meters of the rest.

	<div id="ap-plasma-cannon" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">AP plasma cannons</i> are typically rotating-barrel weapons that fire a high volume of magnetically contained
			plasma charges. They are designed for anti-personnel use and do not count as gunnery for the sake of overcoming armor. They are heavy,
			however, and require strength 14 to wield without a mount.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="av-plasma-cannon" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">AV plasma cannons</i> fire large charges of magnetically contained plasma designed to decimate vehicles. These
			weapons have a charge time that makes targeting anything human in size difficult, applying a -4 penalty on attack rolls against such
			targets. Due to the weight of the weapon, strength 14 is required to wield it without a mount.

	<div id="av-laser" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Anti-vehicle lasers</i> are less useful against soft targets, but excel at penetrating vehicle armor. Against
			vehicles and other hard-skinned targets, damage is rolled twice and the better result is used.

	<div id="burster-beam" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Burster beams</i> are the solution of choice for the more advanced TL4 worlds that want an effective anti-tank
			weapon, a burster beam is a man-portable energy weapon that fires a concussive bolt of disintegrating force at a target. The heavy
			shoulder-mounted projector is a voracious energy hog and requires the equivalent of a Type B energy cell for each bolt fired.
		</p>
		<p>
			A hit from a burster beam is equivalent to a hit from a TL4 anti-tank missile, and requires the same automatic use of the anti-vehicle
			weapons rule. While a devastating weapon against vehicles and obstacles, a burster beam has a very slight lag between visible
			targeting activation and pulse emission. This is enough time for most intelligent creatures to dive out of the beam’s path, making it
			an ineffective weapon against mobile human-sized targets.

	<div id="heavy-cutter" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Heavy cutters</i> are simpler, less sophisticated versions of the advanced pretech shear rifles once common to
			Mandate ground forces. Their shrill whine and the luminous streaks of distorted space that mark the path of their beam set them apart
			from the quieter technology of Old Terra, but they require no components that are beyond the power of a reasonably advanced TL4 world
			to manufacture.
		</p>
		<p>
			Heavy cutters replace the traditional light machine guns of TL3 powder-based armies, providing a fireteam with a support weapon that
			can fire through obstacles that would defeat a standard laser rifle or plasma projector. The stabbing bolts of a heavy cutter can
			punch through ordinary walls and light rubble with minimal hindrance, and even civilian vehicles can be quickly disabled by the gun.
		</p>
		<p>
			A sufficiently well-trained operator can use the weapon as a cutting tool, slicing up to a ten-meter gash in an ordinary structure at
			the cost of a full Type B cell. This same energy expense can cut a 3 x 2 meter hole in most civilian walls.

			check or be stunned for a turn by the recoil. If they have spent at least 1 minute setting the portable railcannon up and haven't
			moved, they gain a +2 to the con/gunnery check. If a portable railcannon is mounted on a vehicle, an immobile tripod, or the like, the

			creatures within 10 meters of that side of the vehicle must make an Evasion save for half damage. Those within 20 meters take half
			damage, and can make an Evasion save to take none at all. Wheatcutter belts do not ignore a vehicle’s Armor like other Heavy weapons
