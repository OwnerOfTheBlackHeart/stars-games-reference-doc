		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Augmented ECM Projector:</i> The quantum taps on this mech have been tuned to interfere with the targeting of
			enemy weapon systems, at the cost of additional power drawn from the motive servos. The mech has an effective +2 armor class bonus
			against attacks from other vehicles or mechs, though its Speed rating is reduced by 1.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="hardened-polyceramic-overlay" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Hardened Polyceramic Overlay:</i> A relative of the same hardened plating used on military warships, this plating
			reduces the armor piercing quality of attacking weapons by 5. Thus, a heavy laser that normally ignores 25 points of its target’s
			armor now only ignores 20.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="mes-shunt-channels" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">MES Shunt Channels:</i> Complex psitech-derived shielding circuitry provides limited protection against psi-based
			weapons, adding 10 points of Armor that only count against weaponry with the Psi quality. This armor stacks with any gained from a
			Neural Static Generator.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="morphic-silhouette-damper" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Morphic Silhouette Damper:</i> Holoprojectors and pulsed ECM conspire to make it much more difficult to fix the
			mech in a weapon’s sights. The effective range of any weapon targeted at the mech is reduced by half. This benefit is lost if the
			attacker is within 50 meters of the mech.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="redundant-systems-buffer" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Redundant Systems Buffer:</i> Substantial power and mass is devoted to a complex array of redundant systems,
			increasing the amount of punishment the heavy mech can take before it is finally destroyed.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vanguard-plating" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Vanguard Plating:</i> Blast vent channels, localized force fields, and advanced damage control monitors are used
			to defang armor-piercing weaponry used against the heavy mech. The armor-piercing quality of an attacking weapon is reduced by 15.
			This defense does not stack with a Hardened Polyceramic Overlay.
