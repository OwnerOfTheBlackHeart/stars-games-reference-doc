<h2 id="special-weapon-qualities">Special Weapon Qualities</h2>
<div class="two-columns-container">
	<div id="ammo" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Ammo:</i> This weapon uses physical ammunition. After the end of every fight in which it was fired, the pilot
			needs to make a Shoot skill check modified by Wisdom against a difficulty of 6. On a failure, ammo for the gun has run out until the
			next maintenance cycle is complete. The check difficulty increases by 1 after every fight until maintenance.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="anti-personnel" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Anti-personnel:</i> Armored vehicles, fortifications, and light and heavy mechs are immune to these light
			weapons.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="ap" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">AP:</i> The weapon ignores this many points of a target’s armor. The Hardened Polyceramic Overlay or Vanguard
			Plating defense upgrades may lessen the effectiveness of this quality. The most a weapon’s AP rating can do is reduce a target’s
			effective armor to zero. It cannot add additional damage to a hit.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="cone" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Cone:</i> The weapon fires in a conical pattern that many meters long and wide at its end. All targets within the
			cone must make an Evasion saving throw or be hit, with no hit roll required. Targets behind hard cover save automatically.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="melee" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Melee:</i> Melee weapons can only be used in hand-tohand combat, and no non-melee weapon can be used that same
			round. Pilots use either Punch or Stab for hit rolls. Mech melee weapons do not inflict Shock damage.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="psi" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Psi:</i> Psi weapons use metadimensional energy channels to completely ignore a target’s Armor rating, except for
			any armor granted by the MES Shunt Channel defense fitting. Defenses such as Hardened Polyceramic Overlay have no effect on psi
			weaponry. Pilots may optionally choose to use an appropriate psychic skill with psi weapons, even melee varieties. Psi weapons rely on
			Wisdom or Constitution to modify attack and damage rolls, rather than Dexterity or Intelligence.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="radius" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Radius:</i> Radius weapons fire explosive projectiles that damage an area, rather than a single target. Radius
			weapons always roll to attack AC 10. On a miss, the projectile lands a random distance, up to twice the radius of the projectile, away
			from the target. Hit or miss, the projectile deals its damage to all targets within its radius. Victims are allowed an Evasion save
			for half damage.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="slow" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Slow:</i> After firing, the attacker must roll an Int/Shoot skill check against difficulty 8. For psi weapons,
			use Int and an applicable psychic skill. On a failure, the gun must cool down for one round before it can be fired again.

<div class="two-columns-container">
	<div id="banshee-vox" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Banshee Vox:</i> A focalized sonic blast stuns and disorients all organic life in the path of this weapon. Damage
			done by a banshee vox is nonlethal, and targets brought to 0 hit points by it will wake up 1d4 hours later with 1 hit point. Targets
			inside a vehicle or behind hard cover are immune.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="beam-lance" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Beam Lance:</i> More power-hungry and harder to mount than a heavy laser, the beam lance is meant to cut through
			heavy armor on enemy shock mechs.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="cannon" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Cannon:</i> Typically modified to be mounted as "rifles" by heavy mechs, cannons are high powered, chemically
			propelled weapons that, despite being inferior to <a href="#rail-cannon">rail connons</a>, sees occasional use thanks to its relative
			simplicity and low tech ammunition. While capable of utilizing many variants of ammunition, the vast majority of mech cannons utilize
			armor piercing, discarding sabot kinetic penetrators made of as dense of a material as practically possible in order to maintain
			effectiveness against mech armor.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="cannon-light" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Cannon, Light:</i> Packing the firepower of a <a href="#laser-heavy">heavy laser</a> in a package usable by a
			light mech, at the cost of weight and armor penetration, this smaller caliber cannon's slow fire rate and small ammunition stores make
			it rare to see fielded by mechs.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="cutter-plates" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Cutter Plates:</i> Rotating blades, force-field shearing planes, or just a really big axe; cutter plates are
			meant for melee combat and carving large holes through obstacles. Suit cutter plates do 1d12 damage, light mech ones do 2d12, and
			heavy mech plates do 3d12.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="finger-of-god" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Finger of God:</i> A psitech weapon that can be mounted only on psimechs and used by a psionically-active pilot,
			the Finger of God is a brutal weapon that operates soundlessly and without visible emissions. The psychic piloting the mech selects
			the target and channels a massive surge of metadimensional energy through it. The blast ignores all conventional armor and can be
			expected to suddenly reduce anything smaller than a heavy mech into a smoking heap of scrap.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="grenade-cannon" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Grenade Cannon:</i> A scaled up grenade launcher for mech use, the fragmentation grenades used render it

		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="hmg" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Heavy Machine Gun:</i> A standard choice for anti-personnel weaponry, though its TL3 tech makes it useless

		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="inferno-projector" class="item-container">

		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="laser-anit-air" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Laser, Anti-Air:</i> This standard light laser has been retuned to optimize it for firing at airborne targets,
			and the range has been greatly increased. It can pick off spy units such as Skywatch Drones automatically once they have been spotted.
			The laser is optimized for firing at “clean” airborne targets, however, and suffers a -4 penalty to hit when aiming for ground-bound
			targets.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="laser-anti-vehicle" class="item-container">

		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="mes-knife" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">MES Knife:</i> This psitech weapon focuses a beam of aligned metadimensional energy into a melee weapon that

		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="mindburner" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Mindburner:</i> Named for the horrific hallucinations provoked in the few targets to survive a glancing brush
			from the weapon, the mindburner ruthlessly boosts the electrical activity in its targets, burning out human minds and electronic

		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="plasma-thrower" class="item-container">
		<p>

		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="rail-cannon" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Rail Cannon:</i> The queen of the battlefield, the rail cannon is a weapon so heavy it can only be mounted on a
			heavy shock mech. A single rod from a rail cannon can punch through the best vanguard defensive plating as if it were tissue. The
			weapon is prone to overheating, however, and makes cruel demands on a mech’s power grid.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="railgun" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Railgun:</i> A standard gunnery weapon fitted for mech use. Some pilots prefer it over the heavy laser for the

			depletion at times.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="razor-cloud" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Razor Cloud:</i> Designed to counter infantry swarms, the razor cloud pulses fractal shrapnel in a cloud of steel
			around the mech. Any target within 30 meters is automatically hit, and may make an Evasion save for half damage. Any target within 60
			meters is automatically hit for half damage, and may make an Evasion save to take none. Hard cover protects a subject from the cloud.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="rocket-launcher" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Rocket Launcher:</i> A standard Heavy weapon, popular with suit pilots who need more range than a heavy machine
			gun can provide. Rocket launchers also have difficulty in locking on targets of human size or smaller, applying a -4 to any hit rolls
			against them. Conventional rocket warheads are shaped for maximum armor penetration rather than explosive radius, and mech pilots can
			use them even against very close targets without blast danger. Upgraded TL4 equivalents cost twice as much.

	<div id="wheatcutter-belt" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Wheatcutter Belts:</i> A standard anti-personnel weapon refitted for mech use. When triggered, a belt of

			for half damage. Those within 20 meters take half damage, and can make an Evasion save to take none at all.
