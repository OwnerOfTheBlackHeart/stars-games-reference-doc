<div class="two-columns-container">
	<div id="active-camo-surface" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Active Camo Surface:</i> This sophisticated mix of chromatic paneling and holoprojectors renders the mech
			surprisingly difficult to spot at a distance. Suits gain a +2 bonus to Sneak skill checks made against observers more than ten meters
			away. Light mechs gain the same bonus against observers more than fifty meters away, and heavy mechs apply it against spotters more
			than a hundred meters away.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="ammunition-cells" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Ammunition Cells:</i> Mech guns are voracious with their ammunition, and these cells increase the load available
			to the mech’s guns. When making a Wis/Shoot roll to determine whether or not a mech has run out of ammo for a gun after a given fight,
			the pilot can ignore the first failed skill check. The ammo cells cannot help again until after a maintenance cycle. Ammunition cells
			may be fitted more than once on a mech.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="antigrav-nodes" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Antigrav Nodes:</i> These nodes enable a mech to fly at their standard rate of movement. Pretech-grade grav nodes
			can lift a heavy mech, but the great majority of grav propulsors can only be fitted to suits or light mechs. If pretech nodes are
			found on the open market at all, the price is sure to be at least 500,000 credits.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="augmented-enviroseals" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Augmented Enviroseals:</i> Specialized equipment for mechs intended to operate on worlds with invasive or
			corrosive atmospheres. These seals can hold out against contamination or erosion for at least four times as long as most vehicles on
			the world. The interval between radiation saving throws is also multiplied by four.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="breaching-tool" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Breaching Tool:</i> A combination of a pickaxe and a demolitions charge, a breaching tool can be used to blow a
			mech-sized hole in any standard postech building material with one round of effort. Against hardened military structures designed
			specifically to repel such efforts, the same hole takes 1d6+1 rounds to dig.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="bridging-laminates" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Bridging Laminates:</i> A slurry of clastic composites mixes with soil or gravel drawn into the mech’s feed
			chutes before being projected into a tough, durable bridge over chasms or trenches. A mech can produce 20 meters of bridge per round
			to a maximum distance of 60 meters for any single span. The bridge can bear the weight of a mech of the same size class that built it,
			and a total of 600 meters of bridges can be constructed between maintenance cycles. Breaking a hole in the bridge requires the
			infliction of 20 points of damage, or 40 to completely smash a span.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="cargo-space" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Cargo Space:</i> This space is protected and pressurized. If the mech is destroyed, the pilot rolls 1d6; the
			cargo survives on a roll of 3 or more. Cargo space in a suit can carry up to one hundred kilos. A light mech can stow up to 500 kilos,
			and a heavy mech can manage 2,000 kilos. Some cargo spaces are refitted for passengers.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="comm-interceptors" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Comm Interceptors:</i> These polyspectral snoops pick up and automatically decrypt transmissions made or received
			near the mech. Civilian comms are automatically broken, while successfully compromising a military enemy’s comms requires line of
			sight with the source or a recipient and a successful opposed Program skill check.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="construction-array" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Construction Array:</i> This mobile repair and construction array allows a mech to serve as a functioning postech
			workshop and earthmover for field engineering purposes. A mech with a construction array can be used to perform repairs and
			maintenance on itself and other mechs, if spare parts are available. Most arrays allow for carrying up to twice the mech’s own hit
			points in repair parts.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="drop-sheathing" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Drop Sheathing:</i> Most mech drops involve nothing more than grav chutes to slow the machine’s orbital
			insertion. Sometimes it’s necessary to drop mechs in the teeth of an opposing force, in which case drop sheathing is often added to a
			mech’s equipment loadout. This ablative shielding burns away in the atmosphere, but while it lasts, it forces defending sensors to
			make a Program skill check at difficulty 10 to detect the mech’s insertion.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="escape-pod" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Escape Pod:</i> This armored cockpit is programmed to eject from a fatally compromised mech, landing the pilot in
			a random direction 1d20 x 100 meters from the downed mech. Pilots with an escape pod may reroll a failed Physical save to avoid mortal
			injury when their mech is destroyed.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="field-medical-unit" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Field Medical Unit:</i> Fire-and-forget medical drones and heavy diagnostic computing support allow the mech to
			provide medical treatment for downed comrades. When the mech pilot spends a round guiding the med drones, he provides trauma care
			equivalent to a lazarus patch for up to twenty downed allies within a two-hundred meter radius, using his own Int/Heal for the skill
			check.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="fire-control-unit" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Fire Control Unit:</i> These units come in master and slave versions, with up to five slave units linking to a
			single master. So long as the master unit’s mech remains functional and within a one-kilometer range, it and the other units linked
			with it can assign weapon attacks one at a time, rolling hit and damage for each before firing the next.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="grav-chutes" class="item-container">
		<p><i class="item-name">Grav Chutes:</i> Mechs with grav chutes take no damage from falls, even from orbital insertions.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="inquisitor-probe" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Inquisitor Probe:</i> By targeting a visible person or mech, the psimech pilot with at least Telepath-1 can force
			the person or pilot to make a Mental saving throw. If failed, the user gains an impression of their current tactical plan and the
			foremost thoughts in their mind. A successful save renders the target immune to this fitting for 24 hours.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="integral-maintenance" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Integral Maintenance:</i> This system can automatically apply a maintenance cycle to itself with 30 minutes of
			downtime. A mech can carry supplies for up to seven maintenance cycles in the unit.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="jump-coil" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Jump Coil:</i> Any psychic teleporter can translocate their own psimech, but the jump coil allows the pilot to
			teleport up to five additional allied mechs of equal or smaller size along with him, provided they are within 10 meters of him.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="kinesis-boost" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Kinesis Boost:</i> Any psionic with at least Telekinesis-1 can use this psitech to boost their Mech’s Speed
			rating by 2 and gain +2 to all initiative rolls.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="neural-activity-sensors" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Neural Activity Sensors:</i> This psitech functions for any psionic, and allows them to automatically detect the
			presence of sentient minds within two kilometers, with a margin of error of roughly 50 meters for any given mind. The species of
			sentient can be recognized, but not individuals.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="neural-static-generator" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Neural Static Generator:</i> A counterpsi tech, this fitting allows a psion with at least Metapsionics-1 to
			automatically negate any psi-based mech fitting targeted at it or any visible ally within 400 meters. The mech also gains 5 additional
			points of Armor against psi weapons.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="omen-tap" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Omen Tap:</i> A psionic pilot can force a visible target to reroll a successful hit roll or skill check. This
			ability can be used once per round, and a maximum number of times per hour equal to the pilot’s Precognition skill level times two.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="panoptic-cloud" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Panoptic Cloud:</i> swarm of tiny aerostat sensors surrounds the mech out to 200 meters, giving them a constant
			awareness of their surroundings within that range. The sensors provide both audio and visual data, and only atmosphere-tight seals can
			keep them out. Their presence will trigger most advanced security alarms, however.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="polyspectral-sensors" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Polyspectral Sensors:</i> These sensors use an array of emissions to form a crude model of the terrain 100 meters
			in front of the mech, providing rough detail down to objects one-third of a meter in size. It cannot penetrate EM-hardened barriers,
			but does not normally trigger security alerts.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="pulse-transciever" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Pulse Transceiver:</i> The pulse transceiver effectively functions as a faster-than-light communications laser
			with a range sufficient to reach the outer rim of a solar system. Provided the mech knows the location of a receiver, two-way
			communication can be conducted. The data channel is limited to text and still images. Commercial commsats can also serve as receivers
			if a military unit is not available.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="skywatch-drones" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Skywatch Drones:</i> These small aerostat drones are one third of a meter in length, with a range of up to ten
			kilometers. They can loiter above a site for up to eight hours before losing power, and can be recharged with an hour in the mech’s
			rack.
		</p>
		<p>
			The drones have standard and infrared telescopic video sensors and can hover at altitudes of up to one thousand meters. While
			difficult to spot with the naked eye, skywatch drones are very easy for modern anti-air defenses to locate, and rarely last more than
			ten or twenty seconds over a military target before being brought down. Any damage will bring down a drone, but hitting one at maximum
			altitude with a hand weapon requires a hit on armor class 25.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="vivification-field" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Vivification Field:</i> This psitech augmentation is designed to key onto recognized allies on the battlefield.
			When a mech equipped with a field is piloted by a psychic with at least Biopsionics-1, it automatically stabilizes mortally wounded
			allies within 100 meters, with no action required by the pilot.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="void-thrusters" class="item-container">
		<p>
			<i class="item-name">Void Thrusters:</i> These microscale grav plates allow a mech to fly at its normal base Speed. This flight
			functions only in zero-gee or microgravity environments, but can eliminate falling damage in standard gravity, even for orbital
			insertions.
		</p>
	</div>
